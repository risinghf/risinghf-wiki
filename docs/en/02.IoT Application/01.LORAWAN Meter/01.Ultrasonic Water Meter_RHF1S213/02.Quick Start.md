## Tools

1. RHF1S213 Intelligent ultrasonic water meter

2. Gateway to register platform and Settings (refer to https://doc.iotsquare.xyz/docs/manual/iotsquare 5.1 add gateway - chapter)

3. Gateway Settings - Reference Documentation - Outdoor Gateway RHF2S208- Quick Start (link) Indoor Gateway RHF2S025- Quick Start (link)
   After setting, you can see whether the gateway is online on the platform

4. Manually trigger water meter equipment to enter the network and report data or water meter to enter the network actively. Water meter factory default network cycle is 8 hours.

Press and hold down the button five times to switch to the time display mode. Then, press and hold down the button once to switch to the LORA mode. Then, press and hold down the button four times to access the network. (Please refer to the following figure for detailed button switching display. The blue arrow means short press once, and the orange arrow means long press for 5 seconds.)

6. Check the history messages of the application layer or protocol layer on the platform to check whether the device receives related data.

7. If no data is received, 1. Check whether the gateway Settings are correct. 2.. Check whether the gateway and water meter frequency zones and subnet types are the same

::: note

1. The above example uses IOTsquare, the platform of Ruixing Hengfang. Users can apply for a test account from Ruixing Hengfang if necessary.
2. When the gateway registers with the platform, enter the same frequency area and subnet type as those on the water meter.
3. When adding a registered gateway on the platform, you do not need to fill in the push address if it does not exist.
4. DEVEUI is composed of 8 bytes (16 digits in total). The LCD display of water meter divides 8 bytes (16 digits in total) into two pages, namely DEVEUI1 and DEVEUI2.
