## Product Description

This paper mainly describes the application layer protocol of RHF1S213 intelligent ultrasonic water meter.



## Data Frame Structure

1. The multi-byte field is transmitted in small-endian mode

2. The data frame infrastructure is CMD+ VAL0 +... Plus VALn"
    CMD: indicates the command code

3. VALx: data carried by the command code

4. Set Fport to 8 for all downstream data to be delivered

## Uplink Data (device - > Platform)

### 00-Compressed data frame - Periodically reports data frames

|                   | CMD  | Report period | battery | reserved  | Frozen data         | The cumulative flow                       |
| ----------------- | ---- | ------------- | ------- | --------- | ------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| bytes             | 1    | 2             | 1       | 2         | 4                   | 8                                         |
| Value range((HEX) | 00   | 001E-FFFF     | 01-FE   | 0000-FFFF | 0000 0000-FFFF FFFF | 0000 0000 0000 0000 - FFFF FFFF FFFF FFFF |

::: note

1. Report periodic data frame parsing method:

   - Data is less than or equal to 28800
     Report period = Report period Data times 1 second

   - When the period data is greater than 28800Report period =28800 seconds + (Data -28800) times 5 secondsNote: When data is less than or equal to 28800, the unit is 1 second; when data is greater than 28800, the unit is 5 seconds.For example, if the interval data frame is 0x8170 (in small-enode mode, corresponding to decimal data 28801), the interval is 28800 times 1 second +1 times 5 seconds =28805 seconds

2. battery data frame parsing method:

   ![img](https://risinghf-wiki.oss-cn-shenzhen.aliyuncs.com/upload/img/bb48ff82d327dcb79e74d9ef87b03f76.jpg)

   For example, 0XFE indicates that the electric quantity is 100%

3. Frozen data unit: 0.1L

4. Cumulative flow: unit 0.1L

| Value range (HEX) | 0F   | 10 or 71 or  91 | 0 or 1         |

::: note

1. Alarm data frame: automatic alarm will occur when the water meter is abnormal or it can be queried and reported at a fixed time through QACK. Fault type definition: Bit 7-4 determines the alarm mode. If the value is 0, the mode is bitmap mode; otherwise, the mode is ordinal mode. (You can use QUERY /QUERY to QUERY down)
2. Serial mode alarms have the following three types:
0F 91 01 Low voltage
0F 10 01 The temperature is faulty
0F 71 01 The traffic is overloaded
3. Bit mapping mode - When multiple alarms occur at the same time, only one alarm signal will be reported. For example, when pipe burst and water leakage occur at the same time, 0x0F0300 will be reported
4. When bit-mapping mode alarm and multiple serial number alarms occur simultaneously, multiple alarm signals will be reported, such as sensor failure, low voltage alarm and flow overload, will be reported: 0x0F0400 0F9101 0F7101
5. If the fault identifier bit is 1, the fault occurs. If the fault identifier bit is 0, the fault does not occur

::: note

1. Analysis method of reporting periodic data frames:

- Data is less than or equal to 28800
Report period = Report period Data times 1 second
- When the period data is greater than 28800
Report period =28800 seconds + (Data -28800) times 5 seconds
Note: When data is less than or equal to 28800, the unit is 1 second; when data is greater than 28800, the unit is 5 seconds.
For example, if the interval data frame is 0x8170 (in small-enode mode, corresponding to decimal data 28801), the interval is 28800 times 1 second +1 times 5 seconds =28805 seconds
