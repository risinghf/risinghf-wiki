## Tools 

1. RHF1S213 Intelligent ultrasonic water meter

## Before Installation

1. Ultrasonic water meter belongs to a relatively valuable precision instrument. It must be carefully picked up and put down, and it is forbidden to lift the table head and sensor line.

2. Ensure that the arrow mark on the table is consistent with the water flow direction before installation.

3. There should be enough maintenance space during installation.

4. In order to ensure the measurement accuracy, there should be a straight pipe section with at least 5 times the diameter in front of the meter and a straight pipe section with at least 2 times the diameter in back.

5. Please flush the pipe before installation to prevent stones and other sundries in the pipe.

6. There should be enough maintenance space during installation.

7. Keep away from ac and high-frequency radiation sources at least 0.5m, avoid high-temperature radiation sources, and avoid direct sunlight.

8. Do not pull the wire during installation and use to prevent damage.

9. During the pressure test, please do not exceed 1.6mpa, and ensure that the flow is within the flow range of this table.

10. Installation must follow the direction of flow indication arrow on the pipe section.

11. It can be installed horizontally or vertically, but the two transducers should be on the same horizontal plane during horizontal installation. Vertical installation should ensure water flow from bottom to top.

12. When installing outdoor pipes, please keep the pipes and water meter insulated to prevent freezing and cracking in winter.

## Installation Position Requirements

The installation method shown in figure A is correct. The meter is installed at the lower position of the pipe. There is back pressure at the back end of the meter, which will not cause bubbles to affect the measurement accuracy.

The installation method shown in figure B is wrong. The meter is installed on the upper part of the pipe, which is easy to accumulate bubbles and affect the measurement accuracy.

The installation method shown in C in the figure is wrong. This installation position is vertical installation with water inlet, which is not allowed. There is no back pressure at the back end of the meter, which may cause the phenomenon that the fluid in the pipeline cannot be fully filled, thus affecting the measurement accuracy.

The installation mode shown in figure D is correct, and this installation position will not produce bubbles, which is the same as A, which is vertical installation mode.
