# IoTSquare API

::: warning

This document describes the interface invocation method for the RisingHF IoTSqaure server and the custom application
server, IoTSqaure provides data push and data delivery based on the HTTP protocol, using JSON to encode data

Refer to https://www.json.org/ for definitions of the json format

:::

## 1 Data Push

### 1.1 Push Link

Data push includes gateway heartbeat status push, gateway online/offline push, device join push, and application layer
uplink data push,

The IoTSqaure configures the push link by application, and the data of all devices under the same application is pushed
to the user-configured URL. Data push uses POST method, which automatically adopt the HTTPS/HTTP protocol based on
user-configured link

User need to provide a URL link, for example:

```
https://test.risinghf.com
```

The IoTSqaure adds a path after the link, corresponding to different data formats and pushes, for example:

**Join Message:**

```
https://test.risinghf.com/join
```

**Application Layer Data Uplink:**

```
https://test.risinghf.com/uplink
```

**Gateway heartbeat status:**

```
https://test.risinghf.com/gwstat
```

**Gateway online/offline:**

```
https://test.risinghf.com/gwconnection
```

### 1.2 Request Header

IoTSqaure supports custom request header information, user can set token or user information in the request header and
send it along with the data push, for example:

The user configures the contents of the Token request header field in the IoTSqaure as **ImsIuxj+Dg0/ClYJ9vdqYw==**

The token is directly obtained in the received request header, and the following is an example of the received request
header.

```
Content-Type: application/json
Accept-Encoding: gzip
User-Agent: Go-http-client/1.1
Content-Length: 286
x-access-token: ImsIuxj+Dg0/ClYJ9vdqYw==
```

### 1.3 Data Format

IoTSqaure uses a predetermined data format, which depends on the packet type, the following fields are fixedly sent:

```
{
    "devEUI": "574abd9100390397",
    "appID": 2,
    "time": 1543227536125,
    "type": "uplink",
    "data": object
}
```

**Field Parsing**

| Field Name | Type   | Description                                                                          |
|------------|--------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **devEUI** | string | 16-byte hex string, device unique identifier                                         |
| **appID**  | int64  | application ID to which the device belongs                                           |
| **time**   | int64  | unix timestamp in milliseconds, 1543227536125 means UTC time 2018/11/26 10:18:56.125 |
| **type**   | string | packet type, there are currently two types of packet, join and uplink                |
| **data**   | object | content corresponding to the packet type                                             |

### 1.4 Join Message

The following is an example of a Join message:

```
{
    "devEUI": "574abd9100390397",
    "appID": 2,
    "type": "join",
    "time": 1543227536125,
    "data": {
        "devAddr": "00cc8f13"
    }
}
```

**Field Parsing**

| Field Name  | Type       | Description                       |
|-------------|------------|-----------------------------------|
| **devAddr** | **string** | 8-byte hex string, device address |

::: warning

+ CS can receive JOIN message push only when the OTAA device join successfully. After registering to IoTSqaure, the ABP
  device can directly uplink data without join.
+ The JOIN message push time of the IoTSqaure is: After the device join successfully, the server receives the first
  frame data uplink of the device.
+ Since the JOIN ACCEPT response may be environmentally interferenced and cannot be received by the device, the current
  design can filter invalid JOIN information. When the cloud user receives the JOIN message push, it can determine the
  remote device's successful join.

:::

### 1.5 Application Layer Data Uplink

```
{
    "devEUI": "574abd9100390397",

::: warning

+ When the uplink data of the node is successful, it may be received by multiple gateways. The gwid in the data field is
  the gateway information that corresponds to the best RSSI and SNR when receiving data. It is also the gateway for
  downlink routing in Class B and Class C modes.
+ The data raw data in the data field is a byte array. If 0011223344 is sent in hexadecimal on the node, the byte array
  is automatically converted to a printable base64 form string "ABEiM0Q=" by iotsquare before push data via http.

## 2 Data Downlink

### 2.1 About The Concept of Data Downlink

The operating modes of the LoraWAN node has A, B, and C, the node can work in the AB or AC state at the same time, for
data delivery:

+ A mode requires uplink data to carry data downlink, so data cannot be actively sent from the server.
+ B mode can actively send data through Beacon timing.
+ C mode can actively send data as soon as possible with the least delay, but need to avoid the two receiving windows of
  A mode.

Therefore, the above three modes all use the queue to schedule data delivery. According to the first-in-first-out rule,
the delivered data is first queued, and then dispatched according to the node mode. The delivery operation or the call
interface operation succeeds, indicating that the data has been enqueued, which is not already sent to the node.

### 2.2 Data Downlink Interface

When users need to send application layer data to a node, they can directly operate on the IoTSqaure web page or use an
HTTP request. The following is the call interface description.

1. Interface Address: https://cloud.iotsquare.xyz/openapi/device/downlink/create

2. Request Method: POST

3. API Token Configuration

    + The user can find the API Token field in the user details in the IoTSqaure backend, for example: *
      *tl1lzqMMueQUVI+Eyotbnw==**
    + When the user invokes the interface, the x-access-token field value in the request header needs to be set to *
      *tl1lzqMMueQUVI+Eyotbnw==**, and the token is sent along with the request

4. Downlink Parameter Format

   ```
   {
       "devEUI": "574abd9100390397",
       "confirmed": false,
       "fPort": 8,
       "data": "ABEiM0Q="
   }
   ```

## 3 MQTT Publish

### 3.1 Publish（data downlink）

The operating modes of the LoraWAN node has A, B, and C, the node can work in the AB or AC state at the same time, for
data delivery:

- A mode requires uplink data to carry data downlink, so data cannot be actively sent from the server.
- B mode can actively send data through Beacon timing.
- C mode can actively send data as soon as possible with the least delay, but need to avoid the two receiving windows of
  A mode.

Therefore, the above three modes all use the queue to schedule data delivery. According to the first-in-first-out rule,
the delivered data is first queued, and then dispatched according to the node mode. The delivery operation or the call
interface operation succeeds, indicating that the data has been enqueued, which is not already sent to the node.

### 3.2 Publish Topic

1. topic rules

    * publish topic：user/{{**uid**}}/device/{{**device_eui**}}/downlink

2. Complete TOPIC example：

   ```json
   user/1/device/474abd91003xxxx/downlink
   ```

   {{**device_eui**}} is the device ID，{{**uid**}} is the user ID。For specific data, you can view the corresponding data
   of the developer in the user management in the `iotsquare` platform。

### 3.3 Data Publish

When users need to deliver the application layer data to the node, they can directly operate on the IoTSqaure background
page, or use MQTT to request the call. The following is the call interface description.。

1. Request Method：MQTT

2. API Token Configuration

    - The user can find the API Token field in the user details in the IoTSqaure backend, for example: *
      *tl1lzqMMueQUVI+Eyotbnw==**
    - When calling the interface, the user needs to set the **token** field value in the request body to *
      *tl1lzqMMueQUVI+Eyotbnw==**, and the token is sent with the request

3. Complete example of publishing topic:

   ```json
   {
     "token": "tl1lzqMMueQUVI+Eyotbnw==",
     "params": {
       "DevEUI": "474abd910039xxxxx",
       "fPort": 2,
       "data": "ABEiM0Q=",
       "confirmed": false
     }
   }
   ```

   **Field Parsing**

   | **字段名** | **类型** | **描述** |
      | ---------- | -------- | -------- |
   | **token**  | string   | token    |
   | **params** | params   | param    |

   **Params**

   | Feild    Name | Type   | Description                                                  |
      | ------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
   | **devEUI**    | string | 16-byte hex string, device unique identifier                 |
   | **confirmed** | bool   | optional, if not set, the default is false, Use unconfirmed downlink. If true, use confirmed downlink |
   | **fPort**     | uint8  | node port, user available range 1~223                        |
   | **data**      | string | node downstream data, using base64 encoding                  |

   In practical applications, the above `JSON` data needs to be serialized and encoded through `proto buffer` and sent.

The format of `proto buffer` is as follows:

   ```protobuf
   message DLParams{
  string DevEUI = 1;
  int32 FPort = 2;
  bytes Data = 3;
  bool Confirm = 4;
}

message DeviceDownlink {
  string Token = 1;
  DLParams Params = 2;
}
   ```

## 4 MQTT Subscribe

### 4.1 Subscribe（data uplink）

After the topic is published, all clients subscribing to the topic will receive real-time data delivered by the server.

### 4.2 Subscribe Topic

1. topic rules

    * subscribe topic：user/{{**uid**}}/device/{{**device_eui**}}/uplink

2. Complete TOPIC example：：

   ```json
   user/1/device/474abd91003xxxx/uplink
   ```

   {{**device_eui**}} is the device ID, and {{**uid**}} is the user ID. You can view the corresponding data of the
   developer in the user management in the `iotsquare` platform. The data is encoded using `proto buffer` serialization.

### 4.3 Data Format

The developer MQTT client will get the complete `JSON` after going through the `proto buffer` deserialization step.

The format of `proto buffer` is as follows:

```protobuf
message RXInfoSimplified {
  string ID = 1;
  int32 RSSI = 2;
  float SNR = 3;
}

message DeviceUplink {
  string DevEUI = 1;
  int64 ApplicationID = 2;
  string MsgType = 3;
  int64 Timestamp = 4;
  string GatewayID = 5;
  int32 RSSI = 6;
  float SNR = 7;
  float Frequency = 8;
  int32 DataRate = 9;
  bool ADR = 10;
  string Class = 11;
  uint32 FCnt = 12;
  int32 FPort = 13;
  bool Confirm = 14;
  bytes Data = 15;
  repeated RXInfoSimplified Gateways = 16;
}
```

The `JSON format` is as follows:

```json
{
  "DevEUI": "474abd9100390037",
  "ApplicationID": 211,
  "MsgType": "uplink",
  "Timestamp": 1593760116946,
  "GatewayID": "8cf957fffe8002d1",
  "RSSI": -5,
  "SNR": 11,
  "Frequency": 470.7,
  "DataRate": 4,
  "ADR": true,
  "Class": "C",
  "FCnt": 11,
  "FPort": 8,
  "Confirm": true,
  "Data": "ABEiM0Q=",
  "Gateways": [
    {
      "ID": "8cf957fffe8002d1",
      "RSSI": -5,
      "SNR": 11
    }
  ]
}
```

Among them, the `Data` field is the actual data after `base64Encode`.

## 5. MQTT server link configuration

The mqtt connection parameters are as follows:

```json
MQTT Broker URL：tls: //cloud.iotsquare.xyz:2883
MQTT Name：Sha8Hz7biot
MQTT Password：xrPB5jLplALYfJ3Cg
CA Certificate File: `caCert.pem` provided by RisingHF
```

Users can find the above-mentioned related fields in the user details of the IoTSqaure background, and `caCert.pem`
provided by RisingHF.
