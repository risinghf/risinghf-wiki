## Architecture And Deployment

- IoTSquare provides a free online test account and opens full debug permissions and push interface
- IoTSquare backend with scalable microservices architecture and container technology to support flexible deployment mode
  - Stand-alone deployment for maximum customer cost reduction
  - Cross-host cluster deployment, horizontally expand system load capacity without downtime
- Support deployment to major cloud service providers at home and abroad (users need to purchase virtual hosts and related services themselves)
  - Ali Yun
  - Tencent Cloud
  - Amazon AWS
  - Google Cloud
- Support deployment to private data center provided by the user

## Server Requirements
Depending on the customer's target network capacity, server host configurations can be differentiated to save costs.

When using cloud server deployment, do not choose low-profile virtual machines for dev-test environments, if you choose a cloud provider.
It is recommended to use Alibaba Cloud's ECSs for gateway deployments in China, and Amazon AWS EC2 for gateways deployed abroad.

## Operating System

- Distribution: Ubuntu 20.04-24.04„ÄÅCentOS 7.9/8/9

- Linux kernel 5.0 or above

## Deployment Process

1. The customer purchases a server or/cloud server/cloud virtual machine according to the recommended configuration according to the required network scale
2. The operating system requires CentOS 7.9 systems or Ubuntu 20.04+ that is installed on the server
2. The customer provides the server login method, including but not limited to SSH private key, SSH password, VPN login software and account, remote software such as Sunflower or ToDesk remote access password
3. Ruixing Hengfang's engineers install and deploy IoTSquare according to the configuration selected by the customer, and it will be completed within 1-3 working days under normal circumstances
5. After the deployment is completed, the customer is notified by email for testing and acceptance
6. After the customer acceptance, notify Ruixing Hengfang, and remove the server access permission in step 2.
7. Done
   Notes:
   Customers should provide contact information of operation and maintenance engineers or service developers to communicate in a timely manner in case of abnormal situations
