## Introduction
RisingHF LoRaWAN Network Server IoTSquare is a micro data platform customized for small LoRaWAN networks. With IoTSquare platform, users can do LoRaWAN application test, operating, maintenance, and data management quickly and easily on the deployed LoRaWAN network. The IoTSquare can support access for up to 300 gateways and 100k end-nodes

Benefits from years of technical accumulation and precipitation of RisingHF in the LoRaWAN field, IoTSquare provides a complete preset regional frequency plan, such as CN470, EU868, AS923, US915 etc, and can cover most global common frequency bands.

The IoTSquare platform is fully compatible with the LoRaWAN standard and can be seamlessly interfaced with RisingHFâ€™s all gateway types and node products to help device manufacturers quickly realize the ability to internet of things. 

## Basic Function

- Support LoRaWAN standard protocol
  - Support all V1.0.x protocols, such as V1.0.2, V1.0.2B, V1.0.3 etc
  - Support Class A/B/C device access
  - Support downlink window dynamic scheduling algorithm, provide efficient downlink data scheduling mechanism
  - Support automatic MACCMD delivery function
  - Support ADR function
- Support Chinese and English bilingual interface, switch on one-click
- Provide complete device and gateway management mechanism, support device batch import, device historical data export, real-time data and historical data viewing
- Provide gateway SDK online management and upgrade
- Provide Class C-based multicast group management
- Provide data storage capability to facilitate user storage and real-time access to massive device data
- Divided by functional modules, provide a stable and reliable API interface

## Gateway Access Interface

- Support IoTSquare SDK mode access
  - Use TLS encrypted transport for better network stability, security and real-time
  - Efficient data compression, which reduces traffic transmission by more than 50% over Packet Forwarder access
  - Gateway remote control and remote upgrade
- Support UDP access, compatible with Semtech standard Packet Forwarder protocol
- Detailed gateway connection status monitoring logs to help simplify network management

## Complete Data Stream

Most LoRaWAN application services stop at the application layer data push, making it difficult to solve the problem of protocol stack and hardware development and network operation and maintenance. For this reason, IoTSquare provides complete data flow from LoRaWAN protocol layer to user application layer, including gateway, node real-time data, historical data, covering all information of application layer and protocol layer, supporting online delivery, data tracking, and helping customers quickly develop new products and streamlined network operation and maintenance processes.

## Data Platform Interface

- The application can be configured to perform data push and configuration request headers in HTTP/HTTPS mode to implement user-defined authentication and authorization functions
- The interface-tools tool provides NAT intranet users with the same data push as the public network environment when the application enables the MQTT debugging function
- The open interface supports token authentication to obtain node and gateway configuration information

## Architecture And Deployment

- IoTSquare provides a free online test account and opens full debug permissions and push interface
- IoTSquare backend with scalable microservices architecture and container technology to support flexible deployment mode
  - Stand-alone deployment for maximum customer cost reduction
  - Cross-host cluster deployment, horizontally expand system load capacity without downtime
- Support deployment to major cloud service providers at home and abroad (users need to purchase virtual hosts and related services themselves)
  - Ali Yun
  - Tencent Cloud
  - Amazon AWS
  - Google Cloud
- Support deployment to private data center provided by the user

## Server Requirements
Depending on the customer's target network capacity, server host configurations can be differentiated to save costs.

When using cloud server deployment, do not choose low-profile virtual machines for dev-test environments, if you choose a cloud provider.
It is recommended to use Alibaba Cloud's ECSs for gateway deployments in China, and Amazon AWS EC2 for gateways deployed abroad.

| Network size | Micro | Small | Medium | Large |
|:-----------:|:------------:|:------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|
| Number of gateways | 1-50   | 1-50       | 1-100      | 100-300     |
| Number of nodes | 5k     | 5k       | 10k        | 100K        |
| Total number of upstream packets per second for the node | <5     | < 40       | < 80       | < 200       |
| Deployment Mode | Stand-alone deployment | Stand-alone deployment | Stand-alone deployment | Stand-alone deployment |
| CPU       | 1-2 core | 4 core | 8 core | 8 core |
| Memory | 2GB | 4GB | 8GB | 16GB |
| Hard disk | 40GB SSD/HDD | 128GB SSD | 512GB SSD  | 1TB SSD    |
| Network | Gigabit | Gigabit | Gigabit | Gigabit |

## Operating System

- Distribution: Ubuntu 20.04-22.04, CentOS 7.9

- Linux kernel 5.0 or above

## Deployment Process

1. The customer purchases a server or/cloud server/cloud virtual machine according to the recommended configuration according to the required network scale
2. The operating system requires CentOS 7.9 systems or Ubuntu 20.04+ that is installed on the server
2. The customer provides the server login method, including but not limited to SSH private key, SSH password, VPN login software and account, remote software such as Sunflower or ToDesk remote access password
3. Ruixing Hengfang's engineers install and deploy IoTSquare according to the configuration selected by the customer, and it will be completed within 1-3 working days under normal circumstances
5. After the deployment is completed, the customer is notified by email for testing and acceptance
6. After the customer acceptance, notify Ruixing Hengfang, and remove the server access permission in step 2.
7. Done
   Notes:
   Customers should provide contact information of operation and maintenance engineers or service developers to communicate in a timely manner in case of abnormal situations
