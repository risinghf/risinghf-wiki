# Relay Component

## 1 Introduction

The relay service component is a sub-component of Iotsquare server with cache mode and replay mode. The introduction of relay mainly solves the connection problem of edge devices.For edge devices, it is difficult to carry out reliable communication under unstable signal conditions. As the number of edge devices is small, considering the cost factor, it is not suitable to arrange new gateways.Therefore, the data is forwarded between the node and the gateway by adding a relay host.

## 2.Relay Device Configuration

Users need to refer to the UM120095 manual.

## 3.Gateway Configuration

The configuration of the gateway is not described in detail here. If you are using the RisingHF gateway, please check the manual of the corresponding gateway model.

Note: the relay has a new wake-up function. You need to verify that the PKTFWD protocol is supported,The gateway version satisfies at least:
* bridge version: 0.0.8
* pktfwd version: 0.1.0 2021-02-01T04:24:02

## 4. Relay Service Component

### 4.1  Create Application

When the user creates the relay application, you need to select the relay protocol in the extended protocol drop-down box. The push interface can be filled in either http or https. The user can also fill in the token information in the header field to increase the security of the user push interface and create a relay. After the application, all the nodes in this application are defaulted to the lattp node. Tip: When creating an application, please do not enable MQTT permission.

### 4.2 Create Device

The user creates the device, fills in DevEUI, AppEUI, AppKey, frequency area and device type as required to register the device.

### 4.3 Function List

Click on the created device, it will jump to the device details page, click on the relay components drop-down box, you can see the following relay component function module, mainly has the state of the relay equipment management, configuration management, from the machine management, downlink window, history status, etc.

### 4.4 Relay Slave Management

slave management is the slave equipment management of the relay, including slave state list, slave equipment binding, slave equipment unbinding and so on.

### 4.4.1 slave list

After clicking to update the slave list, the relay device will use the active wake-up method to downlink the data. The relay device will report the latest slave list and relay device status and wait for the report result, which is normally approximately equal to 5S.

### 4.4.2 Bind slave devices

Click on the list of bound slave devices, unbound slave devices will pop up, and you can select devices for binding. Only one device can be selected for binding at a time, and wait for the reported results, which is normally approximately equal to 5S.

### 4.4.3 unbind slave device

Click to unbind the device, and the "confirm unbind" button pops up. Click "Confirm unbind" to trigger the device to unbind. Only one device can be selected at a time to unbind the device and wait for the reported result, which is normally approximately equal to 5S.

### 4.5 Configuration Management

Relay configuration management is the management of relay configuration parameters, including getting the latest configuration of relay, modifying relay configuration parameters, relay configuration parameter status and so on.

### 4.5.1 Gets the latest configuration of the relay

Click to get the latest configuration of relay, and a dialog box will pop up to confirm. It will actively descend and relay equipment will report configuration parameters and other information.Wait for the result to be reported, which is normally approximately equal to 5s

### 4.5.2 Modify relay configuration

Click to modify relay configuration, modify relay configuration parameters, actively descend, and wait for the modification results, which is normally approximately equal to 5S

### 4.6 Data Downlink

The data downlink window contains the relay downlink window, using the wake mode downlink or non-wake mode downlink;A downlink record, in which a status bar is issued to indicate whether the node has received the downlink data

### 4.6.1 Downlink Window

Click relay downlink window, jump to ⻚ face downward window, fill in the downstream data frame port, downstream data hex mode, the default choice not to confirm the frame, not wake model, and can be issued downstream data, select wake up mode, and when the device sleep patterns will be awakened receive data

### 4.6.2 Downlink Record

Click the latest message to display the data of the day by default;Select the time filter, the maximum range of one week

### 4.7 Uplink History

Relay history messages contain relay status records, relay event records (binding, unbinding, modifying relay configuration records), and default display of nearly 10 records
