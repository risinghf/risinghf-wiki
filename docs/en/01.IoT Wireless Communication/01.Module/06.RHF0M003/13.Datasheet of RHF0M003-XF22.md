### 4.3 Interface of Module

Except that several essential GPIOs would be used for internal transceiver control, all others GPIOs and interface of the MCU would be connected to external pins of the module, which includes USART, I2C, ADC and so on. 

### 4.4 Reference design with RHF0M003-XF22 Module

RHF0M003-XF22 is integrated with LoRaWAN protocol and AT command. LoRaWAN node design with RHF0M003-XF22 is very simple. Just connect the USART and NRST to their host MCU and send AT command. 

Pin7 of the module could be used to show status of the modem. The LED1 would blink if uplink or downlink operates. Let it float if not used.

Pin8 of the module could be used to trigger the bootloader mode. It’s useful to upgrade the FW of the AT command. Let it float if not used.

## 5 Application in LoRaWAN

### 5.1 LoRaWAN

LoRaWAN networks typically are laid out in a star-of-stars topology in which gateways relay messages between end-devices and a central network server at the backend. Gateways are connected to the network server via standard IP connections while end devices use single-hop LoRa™ or FSK communication to one or many gateways. All communication is generally bi-directional, although uplink communication from an end device to the network server is expected to be the predominant traffic.

Communication between end-devices and gateways is spread out on different frequency channels and data rates. The selection of the data rate is a trade-off between communication range and message duration, communications with different data rates do not interfere with each other. LoRa data rates range from 0.3 kbps to 50 kbps, with different Band Width and Spreading Factor. To maximize both battery life of the end-devices and overall network capacity, the LoRa network infrastructure can manage the data rate and RF output for each end-device individually by means of an adaptive data rate (ADR) scheme.

End-devices may transmit on any channel available at any time, using any available data rate, as long as the following rules are respected:

1. The end-device changes channel in a pseudo-random fashion for every transmission. The resulting frequency diversity makes the system more robust to interferences. 

2) The end-device respects the maximum transmit duty cycle relative to the sub-band used and local regulations.

### 5.2 LoRaWAN sensor with RHF0M003-XF22

RHF0M003-XF22 is AT command LoRaWAN modem, which is LoRaWAN protocol embedded. Customer just need use a simple host mcu with application to control the modem via UART that a LoRaWAN sensor could be designed easily. This will help customer to promote their sensor devices to market quickly.
