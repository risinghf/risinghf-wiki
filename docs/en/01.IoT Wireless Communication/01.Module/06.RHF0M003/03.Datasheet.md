## 1 General description

The RHF0M003 incorporates SX127x and STM32L07x, and is well suited for node in the networking of
IOT.
Based on the powerful functions and performance of SX127x, the RHF0M003 could operates in both
(G)FSK and LoRa. In LoRa mode, BW with 62.5kHz, 125kHz, 250kHz and 500kHz could be used.
And with the STM32L07x MCU, the module could provide SPI, UART, I2C, ADC and some others
GPIOs for customer to extend their application. Two wire interface (SWIM) is suggested to be used for
programming.
RHF0M003 include two part numbers, RHF0M003-LF20 and RHF0M003-HF20. RHF0M003-LF20
support 20dBm@LF band (434MHz/470MHz), and RHF0M003-HF20 support 20dBm@HF band
(868MHz/915MHz).

### 4.3 Interface of Module

Except that several essential GPIOs and one group of SPI would be used for internal transceiver
control, all others GPIOs and interface of the MCU would be connected to external pins of the module,
which includes USART, I2C, USB, ADC and so on.





### 4.4 Reference design with RHF0M003 Module

RHF0M003 is integrated with LoRaWAN protocol and AT command. LoRaWAN node design with
RHF0M003 is very simple. Just connect the USART and NRST to their host MCU and send AT
command.
Pin7 of the module could be used to show status of the modem. The LED1 would blink if uplink or
downlink operates. Let it float if not used.
Pin8 of the module could be used to trigger the bootloader mode. It’s useful to upgrade the FW of the
AT command. Let it float if not used.

## 5 Application in LoRaWAN

### 5.1 LoRaWAN

LoRaWAN networks typically are laid out in a star-of-stars topology in which gateways relay messages
between end-devices and a central network server at the backend. Gateways are connected to the
network server via standard IP connections while end devices use single-hop LoRa™ or FSK
communication to one or many gateways. All communication is generally bi-directional, although uplink
communication from an end device to the network server is expected to be the predominant traffic.
Communication between end-devices and gateways is spread out on different frequency channels and
data rates. The selection of the data rate is a trade-off between communication range and message
duration, communications with different data rates do not interfere with each other. LoRa data rates
range from 0.3 kbps to 50 kbps, with different Band Width and Spreading Factor. To maximize both
battery life of the end-devices and overall network capacity, the LoRa network infrastructure can
manage the data rate and RF output for each end-device individually by means of an adaptive data rate
(ADR) scheme.
End-devices may transmit on any channel available at any time, using any available data rate, as long
as the following rules are respected:
1) The end-device changes channel in a pseudo-random fashion for every transmission. The
resulting frequency diversity makes the system more robust to interferences.
2) The end-device respects the maximum transmit duty cycle relative to the sub-band used and local
regulations.
The RHF0M003 Module incorporates Semtech’s LoRa Chip SX1276 and ST’s ultra-low power MCU.
With only 1.45uA sleep current in WOR mode, the module is really very suitable for LoRaWAN
application.

### 5.2 LoRaWAN sensor with RHF0M003

RHF0M003 is AT command LoRaWAN modem, which is LoRaWAN protocol embedded. Customer just
need use a simple host mcu with application to control the modem via UART that a LoRaWAN sensor
could be designed easily. This will help customer to promote their sensor devices to market quickly.
