## Device Or Module Usage Problems

1. Q1：How to check configuration?

   A1：Each configuration except the keys (AppKey/NWKSKEY/APPSKEY) could be queried by user through query format command. Like:

   ```
   AT+ID
   AT+CH
   AT+RXWIN1
   AT+RXWIn2
   AT+DR
   AT+LW=ULDL // Check uplink and downlink counter
   AT+UART=TIEMOUT
   ```
