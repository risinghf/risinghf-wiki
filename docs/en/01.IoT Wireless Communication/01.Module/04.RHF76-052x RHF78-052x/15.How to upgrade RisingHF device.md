## Troubleshooting

### What to do if "Transferring File" dialog stops going?

For some unknown reason, sometimes ExtraPuTTY stops working with COM port, this will cause upgrade failed. At this time, please power off your modem device, plug out/in your USB to Serial tool and try again. If it still doesn't work, please reboot your PC and try again.

### Why use ExtraPuTTY?

ExtraPuTTY is just a recommended tool, actually user could use any Ymodem tool to do the testing. Even so, RisingHF doesn't promise all ymodem tools will work without any testing.
