## Overview

This product datasheet contains a detailed description of the RHF76-052 performance and functionality. Please consult with RisingHF for the latest updates, Firmware or errata.

## General description

The RHF76-052 incorporates SX1276 and STM32L052xx, and is well suited for node in the networking of IOT.

The module has two RF port, RFIO_LF and RFIO_HF. RFIO_LF covers low frequency band, i.e. 410~525MHz. RFIO_HF covers high frequency band, i.e. 860~1020MHz.

Based on the powerful functions and performance of SX1276, the RHF76-052 could operates in both (G)FSK and LoRa. In LoRa mode, BW with 62.5kHz, 125kHz, 250kHz and 500kHz could be used.

And with the STM32L051xx/052xx MCU, the module could provide SPI, UART, I2C, ADC and some others GPIOs for customer to extend their application. Two wire interface (SWIM) is suggested to be used for programming.

### Interface of Module

Except that several essential GPIOs and one group of SPI would be used for internal transceiver control, all others GPIOs and interface of the MCU would be connected to external pins of the module, which includes SPI, USART, I2C, USB and 10 GPIOs. And there are 2 ADC included in the 10 GPIOs. This is very useful and important for customer to extend their design with these abundant GPIOs and interfaces. For more details of interface, please refer to Table 1 Pin description and datasheet of STM32L051xx/STM32L052xx.

## Application in LoRaWAN

### LoRaWAN/LoRaMAC

LoRaWAN networks typically are laid out in a star-of-stars topology in which gateways relay messages between end-devices and a central network server at the backend. Gateways are connected to the network server via standard IP connections while end devices use single-hop LoRaTM or FSK communication to one or many gateways. All communication is generally bi-directional, although uplink communication from an end device to the network server is expected to be the predominant traffic.

Communication between end-devices and gateways is spread out on different frequency channels and data rates. The selection of the data rate is a trade-off between communication range and message duration, communications with different data rates do not interfere with each other. LoRa data rates range from 0.3 kbps to 50 kbps, with different Band Width and Spreading Factor. To maximize both battery life of the end- devices and overall network capacity, the LoRa network infrastructure can manage the data rate and RF output for each end-device individually by means of an adaptive data rate (ADR) scheme.

End-devices may transmit on any channel available at any time, using any available data rate, as long as the following rules are respected:

1.  The end-device changes channel in a pseudo-random fashion for every transmission. The resulting frequency diversity makes the system more robust to interferences.

2.  The end-device respects the maximum transmit duty cycle relative to the sub-band used and local regulations.

The RHF76-052 Module incorporates Semtech’s LoRa Chip SX1276 and ST’s ultra-low power MCU. With only 1.45uA sleep current in WOR mode, the module is really very suitable for LoRaWAN application.

### RHF76-052 with LoRaWAN

The Figure 16 and Figure 17 below show the power consumption of the RHF76-052 module. The code is optimized so that the MCU and all peripherals are in sleep mode most of the time.

In Figure 16, two RX windows will follow the TX window which is in accordance with LoRaWAN protocol. In the RX window1, the SF of the receiver would set to SF12 for example (should be same as the SF as previous uplink).When there is no packet received in the RX window1, the RX window2 would occur. In the RX window2, the SF of the receiver would set to SF9 (depend on the spec).
