## Introduction

RisingHF™ LoRaWAN™ UART modem RHF76-052AM are LoRaWAN compatible device, supports LoRaWAN communication. These two modems are based on the RHF76-052 module and an embedded LoRaWAN stack. Customer could use a host MCU to control this modem with simple AT command. The advanced nd simple command interface offers rapid time to market.
This document is targeted to help customer to set their hardware latform quickly with RHF76- 052AM/AN UART modem. The only difference etween the two modems is the boot loader interface. RHF76-052AM use ART bootloader for firmware upgrade.

**Hardware design description:**

1.  VCC operation range: +1.8V to +3.6V

2.  Pin22 and Pin 23 of the Modem would be used as UART port, please connect to Host MCU. Pin22 should be connected to RXD of Host MCU, and Pin23 should be connected to TXD of Host MCU.

3.  RHF76-52AM: Pin4 and Pin5 of the Modem would be used as FW upgrade port based on UART connection. Pin4 should be connected to RXD of Host, and Pin5 should be connected to TXD of Host.

4.  Pin14 (GPIO_PA15) would be used to enable the DFU mode for FW upgrade. Please connect it to a toggle switch to achieve DFU enable function via a hardware way.

Note: Customer could also use a SW way with AT command to access into DFU mode.

5.  Pin16 would be used to show LoRaWAN processing status. Please connect this pin to a LED if need. This LED would blink when transmit or receive a message in LoRaWAN mode.

6.  Pin21 would be used to be reserved for LED connection.

7.  RHF76-052AM UART modem support both low band (434MHz/470MHz) and high band (868MHz/915MHz). When use an internal antenna with mismatch impedance, a π topology for antenna matching is strongly suggested.
