## Preface

This document shows user how to make quick test with LoRaWAN modem, include how to configure the modem, detailed explanation of key parameters, how to add node to server, how to add device to server etc.

## Requirements

There are 3 kinds of LoRaWAN modem in RisingHF’s product family now, which all are based on the RisingHF's **RHF76-052** module and supports the same AT commands set.

**RHF76-052AM** — UART AT command, UART bootloader
**RHF76-052AN** — UART AT command, USB CDC bootloader
**RHF3M076** — USB CDC AT command, USB CDC bootloader

Compare to RHF76-052AM/RHF76-052AN module, RHF3M076 is full function plug&play device, with which use could make quick test and analysis for any LoRaWAN network.

In addition to the modem, a Host PC or MCU is needed to send the AT command to control the modem.

Consider to firmware upgrade, user will need an extra open source tool ExtraPutty. Refer to RisingHF’s Doc ***UM01518*** to know the details

**UART configuration: "9600, 8, n 1" (8 bits data, no parity, 1 stop bit)**

## Quick Start

Thanks to the high performance in both LoRaWAN network and Point to Point application, RisingHF’s LoRa modem is very suitable for long range long battery life application. Customer could use it to join a existed LoRaWAN network with ABP or OTAA mode, or just use it to achieve point to point application.

1.  To participate in a LoRaWAN network, each end-device has to be personalized and activated. Activation of an end-device can be achieved in two ways, either via **Over-The-Air Activation** (OTAA) when an end-device is deployed or reset, or via **Activation By Personalization** (ABP) in which the two steps of end-device personalization and activation are done as one step.

2.  To achieve Point to Point application, the device should be configured to TEST mode first by AT command. You can use two modems to communicate with each other, or you could use RisingHF’s modem to communicate with others LoRa device.

Refer the table below about relationship of key, ID, EUI and mode:

| Mode | ID/EUI         | Key              |
| ---- | -------------- | ---------------- |
| ABP  | DevAddr        | NwkSKey, AppSKey |
| OTAA | AppEUI, DevEUI | AppKey           |

### Application with Custom data rate

Except that EU868 and US915 data rate scheme, RisingHF modem also support custom data rate scheme. This need customer know deeply in LoRa and LoRaWAN before define a custom data rate scheme.

For example,

AT+DR=custom

+DR: CUSTOM

AT+DR=Scheme

+DR: CUSTOM

+DR: CUSTOM DR0 RFU

+DR: CUSTOM DR1 RFU

+DR: CUSTOM DR2 RFU

+DR: CUSTOM DR3 RFU

+DR: CUSTOM DR4 RFU

+DR: CUSTOM DR5 RFU

+DR: CUSTOM DR6 RFU

+DR: CUSTOM DR7 RFU

+DR: CUSTOM DR8 RFU

+DR: CUSTOM DR9 RFU

+DR: CUSTOM DR10 RFU

+DR: CUSTOM DR11 RFU

+DR: CUSTOM DR12 RFU

+DR: CUSTOM DR13 RFU

+DR: CUSTOM DR14 RFU

+DR: CUSTOM DR15 RFU

AT+DR=Custom,DR0,SF10,125

+DR: CUSTOM DR0 SF10 BW125K

AT+DR=Custom,DR1,SF9,125

+DR: CUSTOM DR1 SF9 BW125K

AT+DR=Custom,DR2,SF8,125

+DR: CUSTOM DR2 SF8 BW125K

AT+DR=Custom,DR3,SF7,125

+DR: CUSTOM DR3 SF7 BW125K

AT+DR=Custom,DR4,SF7,500

+DR: CUSTOM DR4 SF7 BW500K

*//Here we define DR0 to DR4 totally 5 kinds of data rate different from LoRaWAN definition. Note that both GW and Node should follow this rule when in custom data rate definition//*

AT+DR=Scheme *//Check the data rate scheme again//*

+DR: CUSTOM

+DR: CUSTOM DR0 SF10 BW125K

+DR: CUSTOM DR1 SF9 BW125K

+DR: CUSTOM DR2 SF8 BW125K

+DR: CUSTOM DR3 SF7 BW125K

+DR: CUSTOM DR14 RFU

+DR: CUSTOM DR15 RFU

### Application with Full-duplex gateway

A gateway support full-duplex, which means that there is a frequency shift for downlink and uplink of gateway. With AT+RXWIN1 and AT+RXWIN2 command, RisingHF modem could achieve this easily to support full-duplex gateway. In default, the frequency shift in RXWIN1 is off, that the downlink use the same frequency as the uplink in RXWIN1. If you want to shift a frequency offset, then use “AT+RXWIN1=ON” to set to ON.

For example, uplink use 8 channels: 471.5MHz, 471.7MHz, 471.9MHz, 472.1MHz, 472.3MHz, 472.5MHz, 472.7MHz and 472.9MHz; downlink use another 8 channels with a fixed shift frequency, 10MHz for example, i.e. 481.5MHz, 481.7MHz, 481.9MHz, 482.1MHz, 482.3MHz, 482.5MHz, 482.7MHz and 482.9MHz. You can configure the modem like below:

AT+CH=0,471.5,DR0,DR5 *//Set the uplink channel and data rate//*

+CH: 0,471500000,DR0:DR5

AT+CH=1,471.7,DR0,DR5

+CH: 1,471700000,DR0:DR5

AT+CH=2,471.9,DR0,DR5

+CH: 2,471900000,DR0:DR5

AT+CH=3,472.1,DR0,DR5

+CH: 3,472100000,DR0:DR5

AT+CH=4,472.3,DR0,DR5

+CH: 4,472300000,DR0:DR5

AT+CH=5,472.5,DR0,DR5

+CH: 5,472500000,DR0:DR5

AT+CH=6,472.7,DR0,DR5

+CH: 6,472700000,DR0:DR5

AT+CH=7,472.9,DR0,DR5

+CH: 7,472900000,DR0:DR5

AT+RXWIN1=ON *//Enable the RXWIN1 configuration command//*

+RXWIN1: ON

AT+RXWIN1=0,481.5 *//set downlink frequency channel in RXWIN1 to achieve full-duplex of the gateway//*

+RXWIN1 0,481500000

AT+RXWIN1=1,481.7

+RXWIN1 1,481700000

AT+RXWIN1=2,481.9

+RXWIN1 2,481900000

AT+RXWIN1=3,482.1

+RXWIN1 3,482100000

AT+RXWIN1=4,482.3

+RXWIN1 4,482300000

AT+RXWIN1=5,482.5

+RXWIN1 5,482500000

AT+RXWIN1=6,482.7

+RXWIN1 6,482700000

AT+RXWIN1=7,482.9

+RXWIN1 7,482900000

*//Now the modem could support the full-duplex gateway with the RXWIN1 with shift frequency channel//*

### Downlink

LoRaWAN modem is bidirectional device, so downlink could be received if server transmits. In  LoRaWAN Class A mode, two receive windows will be opened to receive downlink from server,  however LoRaWAN Class C device could receive downlink from server at almost any time.  Following example shows how modem reports received downlink message.

Example: *(CMSG)*

**+CMSG: Start LoRaWAN transaction**

**+CMSG: TX "RisingHF"**

**+CMSG: Wait ACK**

**+CMSG: ACK Received**

**+CMSG: PORT: 5; RX: "14 54 54"**

**+CMSG: RXWIN2, RSSI -88, SNR 13.5**

**+CMSG: Done**

Example: *(Class C)*

**+CMSG: ACK Received**

**+CMSG: PORT: 5; RX: "14 54 54"**

**+CMSG: RXWIN2, RSSI -88, SNR 13.5**

Class C downlink will use last message command  (MSG/CMSG/MSGHEX/CMSGHEX) as its prompt symbol. Could be any of below cases.

**+MSG: PORT: 5; RX: "14 54 54"**

**+CMSG: PORT: 5; RX: "14 54 54"**

**+MSGHEX: PORT: 5; RX: "14 54 54"**

**+CMSGHEX: PORT: 5; RX: "14 54 54"**

### Point to Point communication with LoRa

RisingHF’s modem not only supports the LoRaWAN stack, but also could be as normal LoRa transceiver controlled via AT command.

1.  As Transmitter

AT+RESET *//AT command to modem from HOST// //Reset the modem when power up//*

+RESET: OK

LoRaWAN AT Modem

+VER: 1.9.1 *// Message return back to HOST follow AT command //*

AT *//Send command “AT” to double check the interface between HOST and SLAVE//*

+AT: OK

AT+Mode=Test *//Set to test mode first//*

+MODE: TEST

AT+TEST=RFCFG,472.3,8,250,8,8,20 *//Configure the modem,like Freq, SF, BW, Preamble length, TX output power//*

+TEST=RFCFG,472.3,8,250,8,8,20

AT+TEST=TXLRPKT[^2],"00 00 01 00 00 AF 80 07 02 00 00 39"*//You could now transmit packet now//*

+TEST: TXLRPKT "00 00 01 00 00 AF 80 07 02 00 00 39 "

+TEST: TX DONE

Note: 

[^2]: There are two kinds of commands for packet transmit: AT+TEST=TXLRPKT used to transmit packets in HEX format; AT+TEST=TXLRSTR used to transmit packets in string.

2.  As Receiver

AT+RESET *//AT command to modem from HOST// //Reset the modem when power up//*

+RESET: OK

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

LoRaWAN AT Modem

+VER: 1.9.1 *// Message return back to HOST follow AT command //*

AT *//Send command “AT” to double check the interface between HOST and SLAVE//*

+AT: OK

AT+Mode=Test *//Set to test mode first//*

+MODE: TEST

AT+TEST=RFCFG,472.3,8,250,8,8,20[^3][^4]*//Configure the modem,like Freq, SF, BW, Preamble length//*

+TEST=RFCFG,472.3,8,250,8,8,20

AT+TEST=RXLRPKT *//Set to LoRa Rx continues mode//*

+TEST: RXLRPKT

+TEST: LEN:12, RSSI:-101, SNR:6

+TEST: RX "00 00 01 00 00 AF 80 07 02 00 00 39 *"//Return the message in HEX if receive a packet//*

Note:

[^3]: Preamble length of RX should be equal to or bigger than TX

[^4]: When SF11 and SF12, the low data optimization would be ON for both TX and RX; others would be OFF.

###  Others important commands

AT+FDefault=RisingHF *//Reset LoRaWAN AT modem to factory default configuration.//*

+FDEFAULT: OK

Note: This command would reset all the configurations to factory default, like frequency channel, data rate, output power and so on.

#### Firmware upgrade

RisingHF’s modem use a tool called ExtraPuTTY to upgrade the firmware ,with the baud rate 115200bps. There are two ways to access into firmware upgrade mode.

1. Hardware trigger way

Keep “**LOW**” for **pin14** of RHF76-052 module (GPIO_PA15) when power on the device. The two LEDs (connected to **pin16** GPIO_PB4 and  **pin21** GPIO_PB5 of the module) would blink means boot loader is ready to upgrade FW.

2. Software trigger way

AT+DFU=on *//Set to DFU mode//*

The two LEDs (connected to pin16 GPIO_PB4 and **pin21** GPIO_PB5 of the module) would blink means boot loader is ready to upgrade FW.
