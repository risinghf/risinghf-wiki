For more information about how to upgrade firmware refer to [UM01518](http://wiki.risinghf.com/lib/exe/fetch.php?media=extranet%3Arhf-um01518_how_to_upgrade_risinghf_device_v1.3.pdf)

### Reset

If the application requires the disconnection of VCC from the RHF76-052AM module or send AT+RESET command, user should wait for 2s from of the end of the POR cycle before commencing communications over the UART port. RHF76-052AM use this 2s to initial itself.

Example: (AT+RESET)

```
printf("AT+RESET");
delay_ms(2000);
```

Example: (Power On)

```
// Wait until RHF76-052AM is ready 
delay_ms(2000);
```

#### NRST

Two millisecond (2ms) negative pulses on NRST pin will trigger a reset of RHF76-052 module, it performs the same as “AT+RESET”.

This pin is optional to connect with host MCU, if it is connected the pin of host MCU is expected to set to floating after reset is triggered.

### Sleep Mode

While RHF76-052AM is in sleep mode, RHF76-052AM TX/RX pins status will be changed to save power. Details:

| RHF76-052AM | Status             |
| ----------- | ------------------ |
| UART TX     | Floating           |
| UART RX     | Input weak pull up |

Host controller is expected to set HOST TX pin floating. As RHF76-052AM TX pin is set to floating, so HOST RX status is not mandatory, customer could decide it on demand.

| Host MCU | Status              |
| -------- | ------------------- |
| UART TX  | Floating            |
| UART RX  | Depends on HOST MCU |

For more information about how to use auto low power mode refer to[PS01509 V3.1+](http://wiki.risinghf.com/lib/exe/fetch.php?media=extranet%3Arhf-ps01509_lorawan_at_command_specification_v3.1.pdf).

### LED

| Event                  | LED Status     |
| ---------------------- | -------------- |
| Send packet            | LED2 on ~100ms |
| ACK or packet received | LED2 on ~300ms |
| Join request           | LED2 on ~800ms |
| Joined                 | LED2 on ~600ms |

### Input Timeout

RHF76-052AM AT engine expects to receive „\\n‟ to identify end of a frame for each of the command, if the TIMEOUT value time passed after last received character, an input timeout event will occur.

​		**+INFO: Input timeout**

​		**+AT: OK**

Input timeout feature enable AT engine to flush input commands in a predefined time to make sure it will not concatenate two commands wrongly.

For terminal tool (PuTTY, Teraterm) users, there is way to disable this feature. It is RisingHF official recommend to try SSCOM to tool.

Disable input timeout:

​		**AT+UART=TIMEOUT,0**

NOTE: UART TIMEOUT status is not saved v2.0.8.

## ATCTL API

RisingHF ATCTL API package is available for customers who integrate RHF76-52AM in their design. To use ATCTL software package user need implement all function in hal-atctl-template.c. And there is detailed description in hal-atctl.h to explain usage of each function and macro.

### DBG

```
/*!
* main.c debug log information
*/
#define DBG(x...)
printf(x)
```

### MUTEX

```
/*!
* Enable protection of critical code, usually be disable global interrupt
*/
#define HAL_ATCTL_ENTER_MUTEX()
 __disable_irq()
/*!
* End protection of critical code, recove the interrupt
*/
#define HAL_ATCTL_EXIT_MUTEX()
 __enable_irq()
```

###  Callback Function Prototype

```
/*!
* atctl driver callback function pointer type
*/
typedef void (*atctl_cb_t)(uint8_t);
```

### UART TX

hal_atctl_printf and hal_atctl_putchar will be called by ATCTL to send data to RHF76-052AM.

```
/*!
* atctl driver call this function to send data to UART
* printf output must be redirected to UART, refer compiler manual about how
* to redirect printf
*/
#define hal_atctl_printf(x...)
 printf(x)
/*!
* UART low level TX one byte function
*/
void hal_atctl_putchar(uint8_t c);
```

### UART RX

User need implement hal_atctl_init function and supply interface for atctl driver to register atctl rx_byte function.

```
/*!
* atctl driver HAL layer initialize, this function will register atctl callback
* function to the UART driver, UART driver must receive all data returned by
* RHF76-052AM module
*/
void hal_atctl_init(atctl_cb_t cb);
```

The way it is called by atctl driver:

```
void atctl_init(bool wakeup)
{
    hal_atctl_init(atctl_rx_byte);
    atctl_reset();
    atctl_rx_tmp_wr_index = 0;
    atctl_rx_tmp_rd_index = 0;
    atctl_wakeup = wakeup;
}
```

### System Time

These low level functions are mandatory for ATCTL driver.

```
/*!
* return system tick, if the HOST MCU tick is not 32bits,
* user should make hal_get_timeout function to adapt it.
*/
uint32_t hal_get_tick(void);
/*!
* return difference between current time and an elapsed time
* old_time
 - an elapsed time
*/
uint32_t hal_get_timeout(uint32_t etime);
/*!
* delay some time, unit is millisecond (ms)
* old_time
 - an elapsed time
*/
void hal_delay_ms(uint32_t ms);
```

### Optional

```
/*!
* HOST mcu initialize, it is optional to implement this function
*/
void hal_sys_init(void);
/*!
* HOST mcu lowpower event, need to be polled in main loop,
* it is optional to implement this function, user could local lowpower
* management APIs to replace this one
*/
void hal_sys_lowpower(void);
/*!
* This function is used to generate a periodic event, main.c will detect
* this event, to use this event to trigger OTAA JOIN or send message periodicly
*/
bool hal_evt_flag(void);
```


## FAQ

1. How to check configuration?

Each configuration except the keys (AppKey/NWKSKEY/APPSKEY) could be queried by user through query format command. Like:

​		**AT+ID**

​		**AT+CH**

​		**AT+RXWIN1**

​		**AT+RXWIn2 AT+DR**

​		**AT+LW=ULDL // Check uplink and downlink counter**

​		**AT+UART=TIEMOUT**
