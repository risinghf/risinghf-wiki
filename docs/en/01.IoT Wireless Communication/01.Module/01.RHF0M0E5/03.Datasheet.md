## Description

RHF0M0E5 is embedded with high-performance STM32WLE5JC, which is very suitable for the design of various IoT nodes.

The RHF0M0E5 module supports (G) FSK mode and LoRa®. 62.5kHz, 125kHz, 250kHz and 500kHz bandwidth can be used in LoRa® mode.

Based on the powerful functions and rich peripherals of STM32WLE5JC, the module provides UART, I2C, SPI, ADC and GPIOs for users to choose according to the application. If you need to upgrade the built-in AT command firmware, please use the two-wire interface (UART) to complete the programming based on the boot mode; and customers can develop the software based on the internal MCU of the module to complete the program erasure and programming through SWD.

RHF0M0E5 currently contains two sub-models, RHF0M0E5-LF22 (Single-core STM32WLE5JC intergrated with SX126X IP) and RHF0M0E5-HF22 (Single-core STM32WLE5JC intergrated with SX126X IP), RHF0M0E5-LF22 supports 22dBm @ LF band (470MHz); 10dBm @ LF band (434MHz); RHF0M0E5-HF22 supports 22dBm @ HF band (868 / 915MHz).

### External interface of the module

 In addition to several necessary GPIO ports and a set of SPI ports used for internal RF transceiver control, other GPIOs of the MCU have been derived, including UART (for AT commands), I2C, ADC, etc. For customers who want to develop software or expand peripherals on the MCU of the module, these rich GPIO interfaces can satisfy most application requirements.

### Reference design based on RHF0M0E5 module

RHF0M0E5 embeds the global LoRaWAN® protocol and AT instruction set. This will make the design of LoRaWAN®  nodes based on this module very easy. The following is a typical reference design that uses RHF0M0E5 to quickly start a LoRaWAN® application. Just connect UART and NRST to the host MCU and send AT commands. 

In addition,Pin24 grounding of the module will force the module to enter Boot upgrade mode.

Note: The 28-pin PB0 must be left floating and not allowed to be pulled up or grounded.

## LoRaWAN® application information

### LoRaWAN® application

The topology of the LoRaWAN® network is a star network, and the gateway acts as a relay between nodes and network servers. The gateway is connected to the network server through a standard IP link, and the node device uses LoRa® or FSK to communicate with one or more gateways. Communication is bidirectional, although it is mainly upstream communication from the node to the network server.

The communication between the node and the gateway uses different frequencies and rates. The choice of rate is a compromise between power consumption and distance, and different rates do not interfere with each other. According to different spreading factors and bandwidths, the rate of LoRa® can be from 300bps to 50Kbps. In order to maximize battery life and network capacity, the network server manages the node's rate and output power through rate adaptation (ADR).

The node device may transmit on a random channel at any time and at any rate, as long as the following conditions are met:

\1) The channel currently used by the node is pseudo-random. This makes the system more resistant to interference

\2) The maximum transmission time (dwell time of the channel) and duty cycle of the node depends on the frequency band used and local regulations

RHF0M0E5 module integrates ST ultra-low power IC STM32WLE5JC. The current is only 2.1uA in sleep mode, this module is very suitable for various applications of LoRaWAN®.

### Design LoRaWAN® wireless sensor based on RHF0M0E5

RHF0M0E5 is an AT instruction set that encapsulates the global LoRaWAN® standard protocol. The customer only needs a very simple MCU as the main control, and can control the RHF0M0E5 through the serial port, thereby easily implementing the LoRaWAN® protocol. This helps customers quickly bring sensor products to the LoRaWAN® market.
