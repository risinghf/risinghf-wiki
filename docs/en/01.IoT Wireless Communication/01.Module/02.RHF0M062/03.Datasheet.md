## Description

The RHF0M062 embeds the high-performance LoRa Chip SX1262 and Cypress 4100s MCU, which is suitable for end device of IOT.

Based on the powerful functions and performance of SX1262, the RHF0M062 could operate in both (G)FSK and LoRa mode. In LoRa mode, BW with 62.5kHz, 125kHz, 250kHz and 500kHz could be used.

The module could provide UART, I2C, ADC and some others GPIOs for customer to extend their application. Two wire interface (SWIM) is suggested to be used for programming.

RHF0M062 is available in two optional models, RHF0M062-LF22 and RHF0M062-HF22. The RHF0M062-LF22 supports 21dBm@LF band (470MHz), while the RHF0M062-HF22 supports 22dBm@HF band (868MHz/915MHz).

# Application in LoRaWAN

### LoRaWAN

LoRaWAN network is typically a star topology in which gateways relay messages between end-devices and a central network server. Gateways are connected to the network server via standard IP connections while end devices use single-hop LoRa™ or FSK communication to one or many gateways. All communication is generally bi-directional, although uplink communication from an end device to the network server is expected to be the predominant traffic.

Communication between end-devices and gateways is spread out on different frequency channels and data rates. The selection of the data rate is a trade-off between communication range and message duration, communications with different data rates do not interfere with each other. LoRa data rates range from 0.3 kbps to 50 kbps, with different Bandwidth and Spreading Factor. To maximize both battery life of the end-devices and overall network capacity, the LoRa network infrastructure can manage the data rate and RF output for each end-device individually by means of an adaptive data rate (ADR) scheme.

End-devices may transmit on any channel available at any time, using any available data rate, as long as the following rules are respected:

1) The end-device changes channel in a pseudo-random sequence for each transmission. This results in frequency diversity and makes the system more robust to interference. 

2) The end-device respects the maximum transmit duty cycle relative to the sub-band used and local regulations.

RHF0M062 module integrates Semtech SX126x chip and Cypress ultra-low-power MCU. With a current of only 2.7uA in sleep mode, this module is ideal for a wide range of applications in LoRaWAN.

### LoRaWAN sensor with RHF0M062

RHF0M062 is AT command based LoRaWAN modem, which is LoRaWAN protocol integrated. Customer just need to use a simple host MCU with application to control the modem via UART so that a LoRaWAN sensor could be designed easily. This will help customer to design and promote their sensor devices to market quickly.
