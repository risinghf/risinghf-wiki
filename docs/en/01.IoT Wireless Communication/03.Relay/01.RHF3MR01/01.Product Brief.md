## Product Description

The RHF3MR01 auk bridge relay is developed and designed by Ruixing Hengfang Network (Shenzhen) Co., Ltd. to address the application pain points of unstable signal and blind areas in the LoRaWAN field application. In order to help users spend the minimum cost to supplement the signal coverage of a small number of edge nodes in the LoRaWAN network that cannot be directly covered by the gateway, and increase the reliability of the LoRaWAN network.

There are buttons and LED indicators for user interaction on the outside of the Auk Bridge Relay product to assist users in the on-site installation of the equipment. Users can easily and quickly test the signal at the installation point with it, reducing on-site construction costs.
