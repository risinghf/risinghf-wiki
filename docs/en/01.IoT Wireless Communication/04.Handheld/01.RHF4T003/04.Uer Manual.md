![image-20210907142700419](https://risinghf-wiki.oss-cn-shenzhen.aliyuncs.com/upload/img/4ec337b1594a2551321b2c80676f397f.png)

#### Parameter Explanation

-   **Uplink Margin**

Uplink Margin is Link Margin of Uplink (Handheld field tester Transmit
to Gateway), The value is obtained from Network server by Mac Command.

Link margin represent the signal quality to uplink, it is related to the
Uplink SNR (signal noise ratio), and the relation is different by
different Network server.

Take RisingHF Lorasever as an example: Link Margin=Uplink SNR+20.

Some other network server manage the uplink Margin as below:

​	Loriot

> Link Margin=uplink SNR (SNR>0, max SNR=10)
>
> Link Margin=0 (SNR\< 0, min SNR=-20)

​	Aisenz

> Link Margin=SNR+20 (10>SNR>-20)

​	TTN

> Link Margin=SNR+20 (10>SNR>-20)

-   **Test Sequence**

> Every test will have a distinction Test Sequence, The Log file saved in the Memory will also use this Test sequence as a part of its file name.

> The Test sequence will auto increase every time the test is executed, to distinguish each individual test, the uplink packets will also carry this Test sequence.

#### Startup test

1.  Move the cursor to “Start” button, Press ENTER key to start.

2.  RHF4T003 will send the uplink packets according to the configured interval, its type is confirmed packets, and payload length is 10 bytes.

### Micro SD Card File system

RHF4T003 only support FAT32 file system，File name support DOS 8.3 short name.

### Test data file sequence

Every time the Device power on, RHF4T003 will search the documents whose name starts with LW,NS and P2P, and rank the maximum test sequence number，and use this sequence number as the current sequence number.

Example：

Micro SD card contains documents below:

LW00003.CSV

LW00005.CSV

NS00001.CSV

P2P000010.CSV

Then LoRaWAN，NoiseScan and Ping-Pong test sequence number will start with 00005, 00001, 00010 respectively.

A: Because after System Firmware upgrade finished, the Device will power off, and the Serial Com Port is not usable, ExtraPuTTY will out of
connection with this Port, this is normal.



Q: When handheld field tester connecting to PC，the LCD display will lag and slow response.

A: The Handheld field tester MCU will interact with PC, and this will occupy much MCU resource, And at this time, when LCD switch display
content, The picture may appear some lag, this act as expected and will not affect the normal use.



Q: Open PC configure tool, but can’t do anything.

A: PC configure tool is activated only after connected with a Handheld field tester.



Q: PC configure tool occur DEV_RESULT_SYSTEM_BUSY error

![image-20210907151619534](https://risinghf-wiki.oss-cn-shenzhen.aliyuncs.com/upload/img/b5ed6f23c0203c48185165368655624d.png)

A:It is because the Handheld field tester is doing function test and protect the file system, the Micro SD card is only accessable when No
function test is on-going.



Q: Handheld can’t identify the Micro SD card file system.

A: Check the file system Format is FAT32, if not, please format it.



Q:After system firmware up gradation, will the previous configure parameter still be kept?

A: If only Patch change, All the previous parameter will be kept. While MAJOR or MINOR changed， only DevAddr, DevEui, AppEui, AppsKey, NwksKey,AppKey will be kept.

## 12 Special Attention

1.  When RHF4T003 doing LoRaWAN function test, the packet type is confirmed packet, every uplink will request Downlink, this will take most of the network capacity of Gateway, Suggest use a dedicated Gateway for RHF4T003, and don’t share with other deployed end nodes.
    
2.  When RHF4T003 doing LoRaWAN function test RHF4T003, if there are more than one RHF4T003 devices connecting with one gateway, PER may affect and bigger than normal.
    
3.  RHF4T003 support Full LoRa frequency band of Sub-GHz, but need select suitable antenna to match the frequency, one antenna always can’t cover full frequency band.
    
4.  When System firmware upgrade, Suggest don’t contain any Space or Chinese character in the file path，ExtraPuTTY may fail to open the file and can’t upgrade the system firmware successfully.
