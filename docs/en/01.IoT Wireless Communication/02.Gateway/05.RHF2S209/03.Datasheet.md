## 1 RHF2S209 Gateway Introduction

RHF2S209 is a new generation LoRaWAN ® gateway developed by RisingHF. The GW integrates 650MHz ARM Cortex-A53 CPU which run Linux OS. Semtech LoRaWAN ® gateway chip SX1302 is imported into the gateway. SX1302 is a new generation chip with high performance excels in reducing current consumption and handling a higher amount of LoRa traffic.

The gateway uses 10/100M Ethernet or LTE (also 4G/3G/2G) as backhaul. An on-board GPS module could be used to generate a PPS signal for time synchronization. An internal web UI is used for quick configuration and maintenance, this web UI can be accessed via WIFI AP interface. 

RHF2S209 is IP67 design for outdoor usage, can support LoRaWAN class A/B/C application. Gateway is powered by an accompanied AC-DC adapter, a backup rechargeable LiFePO4 battery is optional when order.

The gateway supports parallel 8 channels for LoRa demodulation. The output power of the transmitter can be up to maximum 26dBm, and the receiving sensitivity is as low as -138dBm@300bps. Under a specific traffic period and data length conditions, a single gateway can support tens of thousands of nodes.
