## Device Or Module Usage Problems

1. Q1: Customized global_conf.json file can’t be recognized by packet forwarder? 

   A1: Check below rule. Every object must end with comma, except the last member of a object or array. ( // and /* */ are special comment format, no need consider it)

2. Q2: One gateway receives 2 same packets at almost the same time 

   A2: If the main channel receive packets at a high signal strength, in such case SX1301 chip is possible to receive mirror packet, server should compare the packets to filter the fake packet. 

   Semtech official explain: https://github.com/Lora-net/lora_gateway/issues/48

3. Q3: Gateway TX packet is received back 

   A3: SX1301+SX125x is full duplex chips with half duplex design. When gateway switch to TX mode the receiver is not closed, only switch is controlled, it is possible to receive such packet.

4. Q4: ADR issue when connecting with Loriot server 

   A4: Loriot server assumes that device enables 8 channels, if device has less channels it is possible to lead to the problem.

5. Q5: Fail to connect to a LoRaWAN server 

   A5: If you have succeded in connecting the gateway to a LoRaWAN server but you fail to connect to another server, please check if you have stopped previous service. Two competion service will make your gateway fail to connect to the target server. 

   If this is the first time to connect to the server, please make sure you have select the right operation band which should be compatible with the part number of your gateway.

6. Q6: Fail to connect to Loriot server 

   A6: Please check if you have selected the right radio front-end for your gateway when you register the gateway. Please select 434/470MHz (SX1255) for RHF2S208xxx-434 and RHF2S208xxx-470, and select 868/915MHz (SX1257) for RHF2S208xxx-868 and RHF2S208xxx-915.

2. Q2: Can I use WiFi for networking backhaul 

   A2: No. WiFi is just for configuration and debugging at the moment

3. Q3: PER is very bad 

   A3: Please check points below: 

   1) Make sure you havn’t run two or more LoRaWAN service 
   2) Make sure you have configure the same channels for both gateway and nodes 
   3) Make sure there is no strong inteference or signal
