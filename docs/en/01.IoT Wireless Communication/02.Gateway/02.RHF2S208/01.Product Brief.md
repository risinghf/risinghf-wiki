## Product Description

RHF2S208 is a new generation LoRaWAN GW developed by RisingHF which supports Full Duplex comunication with up to 16 channels (SX1301 Multi SFs). The GW integrates one 1.2GHz ARM Cortex-A53 CPU which run Linux OS. And also 1x or 2x SX1301 to provide LoRa transmit and receive functionality. SX1301 is a high performance LoRa processor developed by Semtech. The 2 x SX1301 full duplex hardware version will extend thenetwork capacity to 4x compare to the traditional 8 channels half duplex one.

The gateway is backhaul via 10/100M Ethernet or LTE. An on-board GPS module could be used to generate a PPS signal for synchronization.

Furthermore, an internal web UI is integrated for quick configuration and fault diagnosis analysis and maintenance. Benefit form RHF2S208 WIFI interface, customer could use devices like PC or laptop to connect with it directly to initial, configure or debug when needed.

Various power supply plans are supported, like DC injector, PoE and internal LiFePO4 battery. It also provides an acid battery charged with solar panels choice.
