### 3.2. Device installation

#### 3.2.1. SIM card installation

If you need to use a 4G network to connect to the cloud server, install the SIM card into the device in advance and test it online.

The installation steps are as follows:

1. Use the M5's Allen key to open the gateway device;

2. Press the yellow button to eject the SIM card slot. After installing the SIM card correctly, reinstall the card slot.

3. Install the 4G antenna to the gateway, power on the device and test the 4G network;

4. If the 4G network connection is successful, tighten the upper cover of the enclosure with an Allen key.

4.  After step above, to check the status of the indicator: If there is only battery power supply, the LED D210 is ON and D202 is OFF. If there is an external power supply, Both D210 and D202 are ON. Cover the gateway and tighten it with an Allen key when it works.

    ![image-20210913113458168](https://risinghf-wiki.oss-cn-shenzhen.aliyuncs.com/upload/img/88b06422cdb234618f572021cf2bce19.png)

#### 3.2.3. Device assembly

This section describe how to Install the gateway device on the bracket.

There are 6 through holes on the bracket for fixture, which are marked from num 1 to 6 on Figure 4-8. And 6 correspoing screw holes are on the bottom of the enclosure of the gatway. Please put the bracket on the gateway and fix them with screws and make sure each hole on both bracket and gateway enclosure are corresponding one by one.

![image-20210913113523731](https://risinghf-wiki.oss-cn-shenzhen.aliyuncs.com/upload/img/50d6559ce0b714d07b36ef4c42de29dd.png)

![image-20210913113542756](https://risinghf-wiki.oss-cn-shenzhen.aliyuncs.com/upload/img/15ccab6ffc8886fdffdffca0f1fe2652.png)

Install the hexagon socket screws, as shown in the figure (part), with two on each side.

![image-20210913113610091](https://risinghf-wiki.oss-cn-shenzhen.aliyuncs.com/upload/img/42c98d3eef8bd4fd09d42890ba473ad2.png)

The bracket has one side of six screw holes for mounting an industrial power adapter and another side with 4 screw holes reserved.

![image-20210913113626197](https://risinghf-wiki.oss-cn-shenzhen.aliyuncs.com/upload/img/09764c3d8806e61483f23ccde59134a4.png)

![image-20210913113654545](https://risinghf-wiki.oss-cn-shenzhen.aliyuncs.com/upload/img/59e2030c4b90b9fb7c1feb3c59e88aaf.png)

Install the industrial power adapter. The AC input port side is facing upwards (towards the LoRaWAN antenna), and the DC output port side is facing downwards (towards the power port), As shown below:

![image-20210913113739235](https://risinghf-wiki.oss-cn-shenzhen.aliyuncs.com/upload/img/11f64ab453e1baa714cafbecb472df9f.png)

The sequence is the power interface, the Ethernet port, and the usb debugging interface from left to right shown on the Figure 4-12. Tighten the cover if no cable is extended.

![image-20210913113757577](https://risinghf-wiki.oss-cn-shenzhen.aliyuncs.com/upload/img/b3d2763593a48233990d66159f89ebbd.png)

Remove the cover and plug into the power terminal from the power adapter. The protrusion on the interface corresponds to the groove of the power terminal plug.

![image-20210913113814410](https://risinghf-wiki.oss-cn-shenzhen.aliyuncs.com/upload/img/df088eea799d2bca2d96cc16b4840ff4.png)

#### 3.2.4. Hoop mounting

The RHF2S208 supports both wall mounting and hoop mounting. When installing on the wall, please use expansion screws and screw nuts to fix the bracket on the wall. The diameter of the rod that can be mounted is less than 60mm when hoop mounting. If the actual mounting rod does not meet this requirement, you should prepare other specifications of the hoop by yourself.

#### 3.3.2. Lightening Protection Cautions

Lighting protection include direct lighting protection and indirect lighting protection. We should avoid fix the device to face the direct lighting protection. Below we just list some essential and useful methods to protect from indirect lighting, induction lighting or surge.  

1. The lightning rod should be fixed above the tower with device or gateway. And the gateway should be in the protection area of the lightning rod.  
2. When the gateway is fixed to the building, the gateway should be in the protection area of the lightning rod which is on the top of the building. If there is no lightning rod on the top of the building, please make sure that the gateway would not be in the influence area of the lightning, or you must fix a lightning rod above the antenna and connect to the ground of the building or lightning protection network.  
3. The small lightning rod should be made of circular steel tube with diameter more than 16mm. The lightning rod should be higher than the top of the antenna 1m or more. 
4. Lightning rod ground down lead should be no less than 8 mm diameter galvanized round steel or cross-sectional area not less than 48 mm squared multi-strand copper wire. When using multiple strands of copper wire for grounding, please make steel tube to prevent the mechanical damage.  
5. When the gateway is put nearby the lightning protection area, please make sure all the device include antenna put below the lighting protection area.  
6. Don’t put or fix the cable to the lightning protection line or area.  
7. Please ground the fixture of the gateway.

#### 3.3.3. Power interface and lightning protection joint waterproof treatment（**Only For Outdoor Installation）**

It is recommended to make water proof enhancement for LoRaWAN antenna lightning protection connector industrial power connector, if the device is installed outdoor. Please follow step below for each connection:

1. Remove the stain around the connection，
2. tape one layer of insulating tape of PVC，  
3. then tape one layer of 3M waterproof clay，
4. tape one more layer of insulating tape of PVC.
