#### Device Information

Device Information displays the basic information of the device, such as the device model, system time, MAC, version number, and IP address. 

#### Hardware Information

The hardware information displays the current status of the key hardware of the device. You can use this column to quickly confirm the hardware status of the device. 

* External Power: RHF2S225 only supports external power supply, and "connected" is displayed by default. 
* Ethernet: when the network cable is not connected, "not connected" is displayed; When the network cable is connected, "connected" is displayed. 
* LTE network: when dialing is successful, "Not used" is displayed; When dialing is successful, the signal quality of the current network is displayed. 
* GPS: whether the GPS module is normally identified. 
* WiFi: whether the WiFi module is properly identified. 
* Temperature: displays the temperature in the current equipment box. 
* LoRa0: When the LoRa-related service is not started, it displays "Not used"; When the LoRa-related service is started, it displays "Normal". 
  

### Server

Server configuration is a LoRa-related service, including environment bottom noise scanning and configuration of connecting servers from various manufacturers. **Note: LoRa can start only one service at a time. If a user has started one of the services and then starts another server, the device will shut down the original service and start the new service. **

#### Ambient Noise Scan

The equipment has a built-in ambient noise scan engine, which can help users scan and analyze the bottom noise of the environment on site, and detect interference signals and noises in advance when customers deploy on site. In order to realize network optimization and avoid strong interference channel frequency. 

The bottom noise scanning function is very easy to operate. You only need to fill in the start frequency point and end frequency point, and then click "Start Scan". If you only enter the starting frequency point, the default scanning bandwidth is 2MHz and the default step is 200kHz. The wider the scan bandwidth, the longer it takes. It is generally recommended to scan only 2MHz or 5MHz to cover the target operating frequency band. **Note: hardware causes that the RHF2S225xxx-470 series can only scan 470~490Mhz, the RHF2S225xxx-868 series can only scan 862~876Mhz, and the RHF2S225xxx-915 series can only scan 902~928Mhz. **

![image-20250617100718056](https://risinghf-wiki.oss-cn-shenzhen.aliyuncs.com/upload/img/image-20250617100718056.png)

Fill in the starting frequency, ending frequency, and scanning steps, and then click the Start scan button on the right. 

When the bottom noise scanning is completed, the configuration interface will display the scanning results in two forms: the bottom noise thermal distribution map represents the transient noise distribution, and the average noise distribution map represents the average noise level obtained by the frequency point during scanning. 

![image-20250617100750751](https://risinghf-wiki.oss-cn-shenzhen.aliyuncs.com/upload/img/image-20250617100750751.png)

![image-20250617100805291](https://risinghf-wiki.oss-cn-shenzhen.aliyuncs.com/upload/img/image-20250617100805291.png)

Ambient noise is an important index parameter that affects wireless communication. If you need to set up and install the Gateway on site, make a preliminary analysis of the environmental noise on site to avoid high noise or strong interference affecting the communication distance and reliability. We hope that the environmental noise will be as low as possible, but the real environment cannot be completely free of interference or noise. It is generally recommended that the ambient noise bottom be around-110dBm, which is ideal. Generally, the maximum noise is allowed to not exceed-100dBm, otherwise the communication distance will be severely limited. If the noise is above-95dBm, it is strongly recommended to change the working frequency band to avoid interference noise. 

#### Packet Forwarder Link

Supports standard Packet Forwarder to connect to servers by using dup. Generally, servers that meet the LoRaWAN standards can be connected in this way. 

Running Status: The service is not started by default, and the message "Not running" is displayed. When the user clicks start and prompts "Running", The LoRa module also starts to work.

##### LoRaWAN uplink and downlink data packets

The following logs belong to LoRaWAN uplink and downlink data. rxpk json packets belong to uplink data packets, and data belongs to the data obtained from node application data encryption and base64 encoding. Users are mainly concerned with tmst, freq, rssi, and lsnr fields. txpk json packet belongs to the downstream data packet. You can determine the downstream data sent by the server corresponding to the upstream data based on the tmst (unit: ms) field, because the upstream tmst +1s = the downstream tmst. For example, rxpk and txpk belong to a pair of upstream data, because 2105654642+1000000=2106654642. Users are mainly concerned with tmst and freq fields.

#### Backhaul Network

By configuring the priority of the backhaul network, you can preferentially select 10/100m Ethernet, LTE 4G, and WiFi as the backhaul network. The default gateway uses Ethernet as the priority network. When the user uses both Ethernet and 4G, the Ethernet network cable is automatically switched to 4G. When the customer changes the priority of the Gateway backhaul network to 4G, the Gateway automatically switches to a wired network when 4G is disconnected.

## Quick start

Let's use servers, gateways, and nodes to build a complete LoRaWAN communication example to quickly understand how to use the Gateway. 

Prepare the environment:

* LoRa server:[IoTSquare](https://cloud.iotsquare.xyz/). 
  
* LoRa Gateway: RHF2S225. 
  
* LoRa node: [RHF3M076B](https://wiki.risinghf.com/zh/01/01/05/01/#%E4%BA%A7%E5%93%81%E7% AE %80%E8%BF%B0) developed and produced by our company. 
  

In addition, a computer and a router connected to the Internet are required, and the RHF2S225 gateway and the computer are connected to the router to form a local area network (the gateway is connected by Ethernet). Then, log on to the router management interface on the computer to query the IP address of the Gateway so that you can log on to the Web management platform to operate the Gateway later. 

### Log on to the server

Access the [IoTSquare](https://cloud.iotsquare.xyz/) server on the browser of your computer and log in. Subsequent registration of gateways and devices must be completed on the [IoTSquare](https://cloud.iotsquare.xyz/) server. 

**Note: If you do not have an account, please communicate with our company for business and help you register an account. **

### Register a Gateway

On the server homepage, choose [Gateway Management]->[add gateway] to register a gateway. 

![image-20230531180322605](https://risinghf-wiki.oss-cn-shenzhen.aliyuncs.com/upload/img/RHF2S025B/user_manual/image-20230531180322605.png)

![image-20250617111240460](https://risinghf-wiki.oss-cn-shenzhen.aliyuncs.com/upload/img/image-20250617111240460.png)

* Gateway Name: name the Gateway according to your preference. 
  
* Gateway ID: Enter the gateway ID IoTSquare the Gateway web interface. 
  
* Gateway type: RHF2S225 (do not select an error). 
  
* Frequency region/subnet range: the frequency area must correspond to the frequency supported by the LoRa module. Select AU915 and select 0-7 for the subnet type. 
  
* Downstream transmission power of the Gateway: 27. 
  

You can click OK to add the remaining information. After the gateway is added, you can see that the gateway is already online. After the server and Gateway are ready, register the device. 

### Register a node

Click [Application Management]-> [add application]. 

![image-20230531151058124](https://risinghf-wiki.oss-cn-shenzhen.aliyuncs.com/upload/img/RHF2S025B/user_manual/image-20230531151058124.png)

Enter the application name in the displayed application window and click OK. 

![image-20230531151138488](https://risinghf-wiki.oss-cn-shenzhen.aliyuncs.com/upload/img/RHF2S025B/user_manual/image-20230531151138488.png)

On the Application Management page, click Add device.

![image-20230531151428435](https://risinghf-wiki.oss-cn-shenzhen.aliyuncs.com/upload/img/RHF2S025B/user_manual/image-20230531151428435.png)

Select add OTAA device and fill in the relevant information.

![image-20250618155328889](https://risinghf-wiki.oss-cn-shenzhen.aliyuncs.com/upload/img/image-20250618155328889.png)

DevEUI, AppEUI, and AppKey are directly generated by the system. In the future, you need to use the AT command to set them to nodes. Of course, you can also use the AT command to query DevEUI and AppEUI from the device, and then fill them in the DevEUI and AppEUI input boxes in the preceding figure respectively. However, AppKey cannot be queried and can only be generated by the system before being set to the device. 

### Set nodes

Connect RHF3M076B to the computer by using USB cable, open the serial port assistant, and set the DevEUI, AppEUI, and AppKey generated when adding the device to the node in the previous section. The instructions for setting the DevEUI, AppEUI, and AppKey for the RHF3M076B device are as follows:

    AT+ID=DevEui,"4E-F2-CD-92-C6-91-05-80"
    AT+ID=AppEui,"79-FE-C2-6F-61-6C-15-0B"
    AT+KEY=AppKey,"33-AF-BE-E0-A1-26-AD-39-6D-79-F8-5E-8A-C0-88-BB"

In addition, in order to ensure the normal communication between the device and the gateway, you need to set the frequency area/subnet range of the device to be consistent with the one entered when registering the gateway, that is, AU915/CH\_00-07\_64, the command for setting the frequency area and subnet type for the RHF3M076B device is as follows:

    AT+DR=AU915
    AT+CH=NUM,0-7

### Start LoRa service

After the Gateway and the device are registered, and the device is set correctly, you can start the Lora service. Here we use IoTSquare service. 

1. Open the gateway web interface \[Server Configuration \]->\[IoTSquare\] and change the gateway ID column in the following figure to the gateway ID generated when the gateway is registered. The two must be consistent. 
   
2. The MQTT Server address and HTTP server address are correct and do not need to be changed. 
   
3. Click the "restart" button at the bottom left to restart the bridge. 
   
4. Click the Start button on the right to start the Packet Forwarder-Rhf Pktfwd. 
   

When the running status of the Rhf Pktfwd changes to started, normally, IoTSquare service starts. 

![image-20230531151748936](https://risinghf-wiki.oss-cn-shenzhen.aliyuncs.com/upload/img/RHF2S025B/user_manual/image-20230531151748936.png)

You can check the status of the gateway device on the server to check whether the IoTSquare is started successfully. 

![image-20230531151714967](https://risinghf-wiki.oss-cn-shenzhen.aliyuncs.com/upload/img/RHF2S025B/user_manual/image-20230531151714967.png)

### Send and receive data

At this point, all the preparation steps have been completed, and the server, Gateway, and node can communicate normally. 

Since our registered node works in ClassA mode, we ask the device to send an Uplink Packet to test whether the communication is normal. 

Before sending data, add the RHF3M076B node to the LoraWAN communication network:

    AT+JOIN

After the AT + JOIN command returns successfully, the node starts to send data:

    AT+CMSG=testmsg

As shown in the following figure, the server has received a message from the device transferred by the Gateway. 

![image](https://risinghf-wiki.oss-cn-shenzhen.aliyuncs.com/upload/img/RHF2S025B/user_manual/2ea682c5-c677-4153-b3f5-1b57c922d213.png)

**Note: the above AT command is only applicable to RHF3M076B and other node devices produced by Ruixing Hengfang. If users use nodes from other companies, please refer to the corresponding user manual. **

## Firmware upgrade

RHF2S225 supports the function of inserting USB flash drive to automatically upgrade firmware. 

Before upgrading, you must meet the following requirements:

1. Make sure that the partition format of the U disk is MBR (GPT format is not currently supported). 
   
2. Make sure that the file system of the U disk is FAT or FAT32 (recommend). If not, reformat it. 
   
3. Make sure that the name of the firmware to be upgraded in the USB flash drive is firmware.bin. 
   

The upgrade procedure is as follows:

1. Disconnect the external power supply of the Gateway. 
   
2. Insert the USB flash drive. 
   
3. Power on again. 
   

At this point, if the Gateway detects the USB flash drive and meets the upgrade conditions, the USB LED will flash and the System indicator -- System LED is off, indicating that the Gateway has entered the USB flash drive upgrade mode. 

If the upgrade is successful, the System LED indicator turns solid, indicating that the new system has started, but it is not fully ready until you see the System LED start flashing. At this point, the new version of the firmware has been successfully upgraded. The device information page of the web management platform can also see the version number of the new firmware.

## FAQ

Q1: the system time is incorrect, which is sometimes different from the local time. 

A1: The system uses the UTC time zone by default, so it is sometimes different from the local time of the user. On the web page, choose system configuration> time zone management to select a local time zone. 



Q2: The LoRa component displays âNot used". 

A2: When the unused equipment leaves the factory, the LoRa module does not work by default, so it is normal to display "Not used. When a user starts a LoRa-related service, the LoRa component displays "normal". If the LoRa component displays an exception, contact the manufacturer in time. 



Q3: Can I connect to multiple LoRaWAN servers at the same time? 

A3: no. The LoRa module in the gateway is an exclusive resource. Only one LoRa-related service can be started at the same time. 



Q4: Why does the background noise scanning function always fail? 

A4: First, make sure that the gateway is connected to the board normally, and then make sure that the start frequency and end frequency of the scan are incorrectly filled. Of course, the scan range may be too large, resulting in timeout. 



Q5: Why does one-click diagnosis succeed but still fail to receive LoRaWAN data from the node? 

A5: One-click diagnosis only diagnoses the hardware related to the LoRa service. Successful diagnosis only means that the hardware is fine. However, LoRaWAN received data is also related to the configuration of servers, gateways, and nodes. We recommend that you check whether the frequency configuration and registration information of servers, gateways, and nodes are correct. 



Q6: The Gateway has been registered to the LoRaWAN server, but why is the gateway not online on the server? 

A6: Follow these steps to troubleshoot the problem:

1. Check whether the network return is normal. 
   
    * If wired is used, check whether the LED of RJ45 flickers. Flickering indicates that the connection is normal. If not, check whether the network cable or RJ45 interface and other hardware are normal. 
      
    * If 4G is used, please check whether the 4G LED flickers. Flickering indicates that the 4G number is successfully dialed. If it does not flickers, please check whether the 4G antenna is connected, whether the SIM card is plugged in, whether the SIM card is overdue, whether the SIM card will be bound to the device, etc. 
      
    * If you are using WiFi, check whether the WiFi is connected to the on-line router. On the web page, check whether the connection is displayed on the network configuration-> WiFi Station-> connect to the superior router. If it is not connected, check whether the WiFi antenna is connected and whether the "WiFi name" and "WiFi password" connected to the superior router are correct. 
    
2. Check whether the server address and port number are correctly filled in. Generally, this information can be obtained by consulting the user manual of the server or contacting the technical support of the server manufacturer. 
3. Check whether the network of the device accesses the server normally. In the \[Network Configuration \]->\[Ping\] function, enter the IP address of the server. If the ping fails, contact the network operator or server manufacturer to check whether the server cannot be accessed due to firewall problems. If you use 4G dialing, check whether the carrier has an IP whitelist mechanism. 



Q7: Why is 4G dialing disconnected and redialed every few minutes? 

A7: confirm the following two points:

1. Check whether the dialed APN is correct with the network operator. If the error is incorrect, use the \[network configuration]->\[APN configuration] menu to delete the incorrect APN and enter the correct APN. 
   
2. Whether the operator has an IP address whitelist mechanism. If you have an IP address whitelist, add the server configuration-> IoTSquare-> MQTT Server address (for example, cloud.iotsquare.xyz) to the whitelist.
