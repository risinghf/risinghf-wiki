## Product Description

RisingHF 8 Channels LoRaWAN Industrial gateway RHF2S025 is an easy installation indoor industrial gateway based on LoRaWAN protocol, which is embedded with Semtechâ€™s high performance multi-channel transceiver SX1308 and MTK platform. Half duplex and Full duplex mode is alternative.

The Gateway could connect to LoRaWAN Cloud server via Ethernet network, LTE 4G or Wifi. The Industrial GW inlcude 3 modes: AP, STA and PPPoE as Router. Only one RJ45 port is provided but with WAN/LAN switch automatically.

The Industrial GW is targeted to be used in Industry 4.0, smart building, smart Industry, smart manufacture and as a supplement for the industrial outdoor gateway.
