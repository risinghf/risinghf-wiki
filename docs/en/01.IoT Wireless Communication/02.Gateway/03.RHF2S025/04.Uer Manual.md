## 1. Preface

RHF2S025 is an intelligent gateway with LoRaWAN ,LTE 4G(optional)and WiFi functions.It is developed and produced by RisingHF. RHF2S025 has a small size, simple appearance and high reliability, which could help customer to setup a LoRaWAN network quickly and with efficiency

## 2. Quick Start

### 2.1. Connect to iotsquare server

The iotsquare server is a LPWAN network service cloud platform developed by RisingHF. Iotsquare provides management services for massive LoRaWAN standard devices, gateways and network communications in the global frequency band, and acts as a data transmission channel to seamlessly interface with application servers.

#### 2.1.1. Add Gateway

a) Please contact RisingHF technical docking personnel to obtain login account and password.. https://cloud.iotsquare.xyz

b) Login to iotsquare cloud server, enter ” Gateway->Add Gateway”,It is recommended that the gateway be named: gateway model _A/B_ number, where A/B is convenient for customers to distinguish between class a and class b gateways.

### 2.2. Connect to internet in different modes and modes switch

There are wireless WiFi 、wired cable and LTE 4G(optional) three ways to connect to the internet for RHF2S025.

#### 2.2.1. AP mode

AP mode is RHF2S025’s factory default mode. In this mode, the gateway could connect to the network via DHCP way with a cable. Please connect RHF2S025 network port to the DHCP LAN port of the router with the network cable.

Except the DHCP, RHF2S025 also supports Static IP access. Please access to the web configuration to switch the mode.

1. Get IP address of the device

   1. Scan the SSID of RHF2S025 in your PC and connect your PC to the device, usually with the default name “RHF2S025_XXXXXX”, “XXXXXX” stands for last 3bytes of the device MAC address. After your PC connecting to the device, you could get the default ip 192.168.100.1.
   2. Connect both your PC and RHF2S025 to the same router, then you could obtain the IP address via DHCP service

2. Login. Default Username：admin；Password：admin

::: tip

Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS;originally, Wi-Fi Simple Config) is a network security standard to create a secure wireless home network.Created by the Wi-Fi Alliance and introduced in 2006, the goal of the protocol is to allow home users who know little of wireless security and may be intimidated by the available security options to set up Wi-Fi Protected Access, as well as making it easy to add new devices to an existing network without entering long passphrases. Prior to the standard, several competing solutions were developed by different vendors to address the same need.

:::

::: warning

Note: After the factory settings are restored, the user will lose all configuration data.

:::

### 3.5. User interface

RHF2S025 provides a total of two external interfaces for users to use, respectively RJ45 and USB interface.

#### 3.5.1. RJ45 interface

The RJ45 network port would be as WAN port in AP and PPPoE mode. Users could connect it to network via wired cable.

AP mode: Connect the device to router with network cable and configure it to AP mode. The higherlevel gateway router can be in DHCP or Static IP allocation mode. For details, please refer to section 2.2 of this document.

PPPoE mode: The gateway could dial and connect to internet directly in PPPoE mode without a router. Please refer to Section 2.2 of this document for more details.

The RJ45 network port would be as LAN port in AP/STA mode.

APSTA mode: Others station devices could connect to internet via this RJ45 port, please refer to Section 2.2 of this document for more details.

#### 3.5.2. USB interface

This interface allows you to upgrade the firmware for RHF2S025. When there is a U disk with FW inserted, re-power the device will trigger the upgrading.

::: warning

NOTE: Do not power off the device or perform other operations during the upgrade process to avoid upgrading failure. The others LEDs would be off for 3 min except the power LED after the FW upgrade successfully.

The device only supports storage device with the format of the FAT32. The NTFS ones are not supported.
