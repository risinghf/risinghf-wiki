2.2 Ping

Ping operation is used to check whether the device can access the Internet and whether the gateway can directly connect to the gw.risinghf.com server. Users can also define their own server addresses. Enter the server address, click the "Ping" button, and wait for a while to see the prompt message.  

![image-20220401113848043](https://risinghf-wiki.oss-cn-shenzhen.aliyuncs.com/upload/img/image-20220401113848043.png)

2.3Traceroute

Traceroute  operation is used to check whether the device can access the Internet and test the route through which the gateway connects to gw.risinghf.com. Users can also define their own server addresses. Enter the server address, click the "Traceroute" button, and wait for a while to see the routing information.  

![image-20220401113900890](https://risinghf-wiki.oss-cn-shenzhen.aliyuncs.com/upload/img/image-20220401113900890.png)

## 6.Circuit Description

RHF2S308 is an new generation telecommunication level IOT gateway based on LoRaWANand target to LPWAN network, which could support half-duplex/full-duplex mode, 8 channel/16channel for particular part number. With an high reliability IP67 level water-proof industrial adapter, the gateway could be installed outdoor easily with maintenance-free. It is an IEEE 802.3 af/at compatibility PD. Ethernet is supported to connect to the cloud server. With an integrated GPS module(MAX-7), the GW could support LoRaWAN Class B protocol with the synchronous clock from GPS PPS signal. Thanks to the industrial WiFi/BT module （ AP6212 ） , customer could login into the gateway in field, which make it easy when engineer do installation and check status of the device in field. At the same time, the gateway supports Bluetooth 4.1 and can interact with the device through a mobile phone application. This device integrate an high performance CPU ARM Cortex-A53 core, one or two pcs of baseband processor SX1301, that it could support 8 multi-SF channels (RHF2S308xx8 series) or 16 multi-SF channels (RHF2S308xxF series), 1 or 2 single-SF channel and GFSK channel. Output power could achieve to 25dBm max. Sensitivity is as low as -141dBm@300bps. With specified payload length and transmit period, one GW could support more than 10k nodes.
