Finally, this article will give some suggestions to solve common problems, hoping to help users.

## **Web management platform of Gateway**

The built-in Web management platform of RHF2S027M is designed to provide users with the entrance to operate gateways. It is very convenient and easy to use, and users can easily manage and operate their own gateways through it. This chapter describes each part of the management platform and how to use it.

### **Go to the logon page of the Web management platform**

Logon conditions: the Gateway and the computer are in the same LAN or the computer is connected to the AP hotspot of the gateway WiFi as a STA device.

Logon URL: the IP address of the Gateway.

When the Gateway and the computer are in the same LAN, we can log on to the background management platform of the superior router to query the IP address of the gateway device, and then enter the IP address of the gateway in the browser to enter the login page of the Web management platform of the Gateway. The login page is shown in the following figure.![img](https://risinghf-wiki.oss-cn-shenzhen.aliyuncs.com/upload/img/RHF2S027M/user_manual/5f066fac-02f1-4a2f-99d8-b5859532934d.png)

When the computer is used as a STA device to connect to the AP hotspot of the gateway WiFi, the default IP address of the Gateway as the AP site is 192.168.100.1. You can also enter the login page by using this IP address.

The following is the WiFi hotspot information of the Gateway, which can be scanned directly on the computer and then connected with the default password:

- 默认SSID：RHF2S027M_XXXXXX。
- Default Password: RisingHF_XXXXXX.

Note: "XXXXXX" ends with 3bytes after the MAC address of the device. If there are letters, use uppercase letters.

### **Log on to the Web management platform**

Enter the default password to log on to the Web management platform.

Default login password: risinghf (click the Update your password button below the password input box on the login page to change the default password on the password change page).

The following figure shows the management platform after successful logon.

As you can see, the management platform consists of six parts: device information, server configuration, network configuration, system configuration, log download, and system operation. The following is a detailed introduction to each section.

### **Device Information**

As shown in the following figure, the device information page consists of two parts: Device Information and hardware information.

![image-20230705112301721](https://risinghf-wiki.oss-cn-shenzhen.aliyuncs.com/upload/img/RHF2S027M/user_manual/image-20230705112301721.png)

#### **Device Information**

Device Information displays the basic information of the device, such as the device model, system time, MAC, version number, and IP address.

#### **Hardware Information**

The hardware information displays the current status of the key hardware of the device. You can use this column to quickly confirm the hardware status of the device.

- External Power Supply: RHF2S027M only supports external power supply, and "connected" is displayed by default (some models such as RHF2S209 support lithium battery power supply).
- Ethernet: when the network cable is not connected, it displays "not connected"; When the network cable is connected, it displays "connected".
- LTE network: when dialing is successful, it displays "unused"; When dialing is successful, it displays the signal quality of the current network.
- WiFi: whether the WiFi module is properly identified.
- Temperature: displays the temperature in the current equipment box.
- LoRa component 0: When the LoRa-related service is not started, it displays "unused"; When the LoRa-related service is started, it displays "normal".

### **Server Configuration**

#### **Background noise scanning**

RHF2S027M provides the function of scanning the bottom noise of the environment. This function can collect the noise in the specified frequency band of the current environment and display it in the form of Curve diagram and heat distribution diagram.

![image-20230705112357535](https://risinghf-wiki.oss-cn-shenzhen.aliyuncs.com/upload/img/RHF2S027M/user_manual/image-20230705112357535.png)

Fill in the starting frequency, ending frequency, and scanning steps, and then click the Start scan button on the right.

**Note that the maximum value of the scan band cannot be less than 100MHz and the minimum value cannot be greater than 1000MHz.**

#### **Packet Forwarder Link**

The standard Packet Forwarder uses UDP to connect to the server. Generally, servers that meet the LoRaWAN standards can be connected in this way. The configuration interface is shown in the following figure.

![image-20230705112435902](https://risinghf-wiki.oss-cn-shenzhen.aliyuncs.com/upload/img/RHF2S027M/user_manual/image-20230705112435902.png)

- Gateway ID: Enter the gateway ID (note that different servers use different gateway ID naming rules). By default, RHF2S027M uses the MAC address of the Ethernet to insert FFFE as the gateway ID, which can be modified according to your needs.
- Server Address: Enter the destination server address.
- Uplink port: the uplink port number of the target server.
- Downstream Port: The downstream port number of the target server.
- Frequency configuration: Select the frequency configuration file supported by the Gateway. You can specify a frequency plan based on your needs.

After completing the configuration items, click the Start button below to start the Packet Forwarder.

#### **IoTSquare**

[IoTSquare](https://cloud.iotsquare.xyz)Is a program used to connect to IoTSquare server. It is mainly composed of two parts, one is bridge and the other is Packet Forwarder. bridge is the core program used to connect to IoTSquare servers. Packet Forwarder is responsible for sending and receiving LoRaWAN data.

When the Packet Forwarder is not started, only the gateway establishes a connection with the IoTSquare server through the bridge in the entire communication link. At this time, if a gateway has been registered on the server, the gateway device can be remotely managed on the Gateway management platform of the server;After the Packet Forwarder is started, the complete communication link between the node, Gateway, and server is connected. In this case, the server can remotely manage the device and send and receive LoRaWAN data. By default, only bridge is started.

![img](https://risinghf-wiki.oss-cn-shenzhen.aliyuncs.com/upload/img/RHF2S027M/user_manual/88c54eb7-4531-45b2-9532-825c7273fb82.png)

The following figure shows the configuration/startup interface of the IoTSquare.

![image-20230705112517366](https://risinghf-wiki.oss-cn-shenzhen.aliyuncs.com/upload/img/RHF2S027M/user_manual/image-20230705112517366.png)

- Gateway ID: Enter the gateway ID. By default, IoTSquare use the MAC address of the Ethernet to insert FFFE as the gateway ID. You can modify it according to your needs.
- MQTT Server Address: Enter the MQTT address and port number of the target server.
- HTTP server address: Enter the HTTP address and port number of the destination server.

Note: When you need to start the IoTSquare Packet Forwarder -- Rhf Pktfwd, you must first register the gateway on the IoTSquare service, and the ID of the registered gateway must be the same as the gateway ID specified in the preceding figure. After the registration is successful, bridge automatically loads the information such as the frequency area/subnet type, up/down Port, etc. entered when the user registers the gateway for the Packet Forwarder,Therefore, unlike Packet Forwarder Link, starting IotSquare in Packet Forwarder does not need to fill in this information.

#### **LoraServer**

Used to connect to an open-source LoraServer. The LoRa service requires users to upload their own configuration files to the/home/rxhf/loraserver directory instead of lora-gateway-bridge.toml configuration files.

![image-20230705112532109](https://risinghf-wiki.oss-cn-shenzhen.aliyuncs.com/upload/img/RHF2S027M/user_manual/image-20230705112532109.png)

- Gateway ID: Enter the gateway ID (note that different servers use different gateway ID naming rules). By default, RHF2S027M uses the MAC address of the Ethernet to insert FFFE as the gateway ID, which can be modified according to your needs.

DevEUI, AppEUI, and AppKey are directly generated by the system. In the future, you need to use the AT command to set them to nodes. Of course, you can also use the AT command to query DevEUI and AppEUI from devices, and then fill them in the DevEUI and AppEUI input boxes in the preceding figure respectively,However, the AppKey cannot be queried and can only be generated by the system before being set to the device.

### **Configure nodes**

Connect RHF3M076B to the computer by using USB cable, open the serial port assistant, and set the DevEUI, AppEUI, and AppKey generated when adding the device to the node in the previous section. The instructions for setting the DevEUI, AppEUI, and AppKey for the RHF3M076B device are as follows:

```
AT+ID=DevEui,"4E-F2-CD-92-C6-91-05-80"
AT+ID=AppEui,"79-FE-C2-6F-61-6C-15-0B"
AT+KEY=AppKey,"33-AF-BE-E0-A1-26-AD-39-6D-79-F8-5E-8A-C0-88-BB"
```

In addition, in order to ensure the normal communication between the device and the gateway, it is also necessary to set the frequency area/subnet range of the device to be the same as that filled in when registering the gateway, that is, AU915/CH_00-07_64,RHF3M076B the AT command for setting the frequency area and subnet type of the device is as follows:

```
AT+DR=AU915
AT+CH=NUM,0-7
```

### **Start the LoRa service**

After the Gateway and the device are registered, and the device is set correctly, you can start the Lora service. Here we use IoTSquare service.

1. Open the [server configuration]->[IoTSquare] menu of the Gateway web interface, and change the gateway ID column in the following figure to the gateway ID generated when the gateway is registered. The two must be consistent.
2. The MQTT Server address and HTTP server address are correct and do not need to be changed.
3. Click restart at the bottom left to restart the bridge.
4. Click the Start button on the right to start the Packet Forwarder-Rhf Pktfwd.

When the running status of the Rhf Pktfwd changes to started, normally, IoTSquare service starts.

You can check the status of the gateway device on the server to check whether the IoTSquare is started successfully.

### **Send and receive data**

At this point, all the preparation steps have been completed, and the server, Gateway, and node can communicate normally.

Since our registered node works in ClassA mode, we ask the device to send an Uplink Packet to test whether the communication is normal.

Before sending data, add the RHF3M076B node to the LoraWAN communication network:

```
AT+JOIN
```

After the AT + JOIN command returns successfully, the node starts to send data:

```
AT+CMSG=testmsg
```

As shown in the following figure, the server has received a message from the device transferred by the Gateway.

**Note: the above AT command is only applicable to RHF3M076B and other node devices produced by Ruixing Hengfang. If users use nodes from other companies, please refer to the corresponding user manual.**

## **Common problem**

Q1: the system time is incorrect, which is sometimes different from the local time.

A1: The system uses the UTC time zone by default, so it is sometimes different from the local time of the user. You can select a local time zone from the [system configuration]->[time zone management] menu on the web interface.

Q2: The LoRa component displays unused ".

A2: When the unused equipment leaves the factory, the LoRa module does not work by default, so it is normal to display "unused. When a user starts a LoRa-related service, the LoRa component displays "normal". If the LoRa component displays an exception, contact the manufacturer in time.

Q3: Can I connect to multiple LoRaWAN servers at the same time?

A3: no. The LoRa module in the gateway is an exclusive resource. Only one LoRa-related service can be started at the same time.

Q4: Why does the background noise scanning function always fail?

A4: First, make sure that the gateway is connected to the board normally, and then make sure that the start frequency and end frequency of the scan are incorrectly filled. Of course, the scan range may be too large, resulting in timeout.

Q5: Why does one-click diagnosis succeed but still fail to receive LoRaWAN data from the node?

A5: One-click diagnosis only diagnoses the hardware related to the LoRa service. Successful diagnosis only means that the hardware is fine. However, LoRaWAN received data is also related to the configuration of servers, gateways, and nodes. We recommend that you check whether the frequency configuration and registration information of servers, gateways, and nodes are correct.

Q6: The Gateway has been registered to the LoRaWAN server, but why is the gateway not online on the server?

A6: Follow these steps to troubleshoot the problem:

1. Check whether the network return is normal.
   - If wired is used, check whether the LED of RJ45 flickers. Flickering indicates that the connection is normal. If not, check whether the network cable or RJ45 interface and other hardware are normal.
   - If 4G is used, please check whether LED2 flickers. Flicker indicates that 4G is successfully dialed. If it does not flicker, please check whether 4G antenna is connected, whether SIM card is plugged in, whether SIM card is overdue, whether SIM card will be bound to equipment, etc.
   - If you use WiFi, check whether the WiFi is connected to the on-line router. Check whether the connection is displayed on the web interface [network configuration]->[WiFi Station]->[connect to the superior router]. If it is not connected, check whether the WiFi antenna is connected and whether the "WiFi name" and "WiFi password" connected to the superior router are correct.
2. Check whether the server address and port number are correctly entered. Generally, this information can be obtained by consulting the user manual of the server or contacting the technical support of the server manufacturer.
3. Check whether the network of the device accesses the server. Enter the IP address of the server in the [network configuration]->[Ping] function. If the ping fails, contact the network operator or server manufacturer to check whether the server cannot be accessed due to firewall problems. If you use 4G dialing, check whether the carrier has an IP whitelist mechanism.
