## 1. Preface

RHF2S024 is an intelligent home gateway with LoRaWAN and WiFi functions. It could be fixed and put at home or in hotel, high building and so on. It is developed and produced by RisingHF. RHF2S024 has a small size, simple appearance and high reliability, which could help customer to setup a LoRaWAN network quickly and with efficiency.

## 2. Advanced operation

### 2.1.  Login on the web

RHF2S024 is built-in a web which could be configured by users. The user can access the “192.168.100.1” into the web configuration interface. Default login user name: admin, password: admin. RHF2S024 factory default mode is the AP mode, and there are two ways to login into web interface.

Use your PC to scan the device SSID (ie WiFi name) which is “RisingHF_XXXXXX”, “XXXXXX” stands for the last 3bytes of the device MAC address. After connection succeeding, use the browser to access 192.168.100.1 into the web configuration page.

Connect the gateway to a router and use DHCP service to get the ip of the device. The hostname of the gateway also is rhf2s024.

1. Access the ip and open the web page:

### 2.2. LoRa SDK

#### 2.2.1. Modify SDK configuration

RHF2S024 is built-in Packet Forwarder SDK, and provides a web page for configuration, User can configure their own SDK according to their needs. Currently available configuration options are shown below:

>Protocol Version: The protocol version of the SDK.
>
>Gateway ID: Gateway ID, unique logo on the cloud server. While the GW ID is a little different in different server, please check the cloud server related rules.
>
>Server Address: Cloud server address.
>
>Port: Cloud server upstream and downstream ports.
>
>Global Config：RHF2S024 is built-in configuration file to modify frequency channels. Please check the HW of the gateway before doing the channel modifications.

::: warning

Note: The above configuration options vary depending on the SDK, and the options may be reduced.

#### 2.2.2. Switch SDK

RHF2S024 currently supports the following SDK: 

1. Semtech Packet Forwarder
2. TTN Packet Forwarder

In the web page Lora menu, each level 2 menu represents an SDK. If the menu name is appended with (enable), it means that the SDK is running. User can switch the SDK as needed. Just click Enable in the SDK page, you can close the previous SDK and run another one.

### 2.3. Led instruction

RHF2S024 panel provides a total of five LED for functional instructions, which make users know the different status of the device. They are Power, System, WiFi, LoRa and USB instruction LEDs. In the network RJ45 port there is another LED to show network status.

![](https://wiki.risinghf.com/upload/img/437fdaccc2924d97f4cd65ac2e28a0b9.png)

| Type       | Description                                                  |

| System led | When the system is fully activated, the led shows green and blinks slowly; when you press the RESET button to restore the factory settings, the led blinks quickly; when you press RESET button to restart the system, the led keeps on; when the device is in upgrading, led blinks slowly. |
| WiFi led   | The WiFi led is a tri-color led, which include green, red and orange. When the WiFi signal is strong, the led is green; if the WiFi signal is poor, the led is orange; in other cases it is red. |
| LoRa led   | The LoRa led include green and red two instructions state. When the system is fully activated, and the gateway start the packet forwarder successfully, it is green; otherwise it is red. |
| USB led    | When there is a U disk the led is always green. If the device is reading from U disk, the led will blink. |
| RJ45 led   | When the device connect to network via cable, the led will blink |

::: warning

Note: The System led, WiFi led, LoRa led and USB led will be on for 2 seconds during system startup.

### 2.4. Key

RHF2S024 have two keys, respectively FCT key and RESET key.

| Type      | Description                                                  |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| FCT key   | Keep pressing the key for more than 1 second, to enter the WPS mode. |
| RESET key | Keep pressing the key for more than 1 second and less than 5 second, the device will restart; Keep pressing the key for more than 5 seconds, the device is restored to factory settings. |

::: tip

Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS;originally, Wi-Fi Simple Config) is a network security standard to create a secure wireless home network.Created by the Wi-Fi Alliance and introduced in 2006, the goal of the protocol is to allow home users who know little of wireless security and may be intimidated by the available security options to set up Wi-Fi Protected Access, as well as making it easy to add new devices to an existing network without entering long passphrases. Prior to the standard, several competing solutions were developed by different vendors to address the same need. 

:::

::: warning

Note: After the factory settings are restored, the user will lose all configuration data.

### 2.5. User interface

RHF2S024 provides a total of two external interfaces for users to use, respectively RJ45 and USB interface.

#### 2.5.1. RJ45 interface

The RJ45 network port would be as WAN port in AP and PPPoE mode. Users could connect it to network via wired cable.

AP mode: Connect the device to router with network cable and configure it to AP mode. The higherlevel gateway router can be in DHCP or Static IP allocation mode. For details, please refer to section 2.2 of this document. 

PPPoE mode: The gateway could dial and connect to internet directly in PPPoE mode without a router. Please refer to Section 2.2 of this document for more details.

The RJ45 network port would be as LAN port in AP/STA mode.

APSTA mode: Others station devices could connect to internet via this RJ45 port, please refer to Section 2.2 of this document for more details

#### 2.5.2. USB interface

This interface allows you to upgrade the firmware for RHF2S024. When there is a U disk with FW inserted, re-power the device will trigger the upgrading.

::: warning

Do not power off the device or perform other operations during the upgrade process to avoid upgrading failure. The others LEDs would be off for 3 min except the power LED after the FW upgrade successfully.

The device only supports storage device with the format of the FAT32. The NTFS ones are not supported.
