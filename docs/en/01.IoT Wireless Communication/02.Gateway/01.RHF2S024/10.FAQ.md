## Device Or Module Usage Problems

1. Q1：RHF2S024 provides three kinds of mode to connect to network, but how to use them? 

   A1：APmode: When the gateway is far away from the router, but a wired connection is possible. APSTA mode: When the gateway is nearby the router and WiFi signal is strong. PPPoE mode: No superior router, gateway device need dial and connect to network directly.

2. Q2：I want to switch to APSTA mode, but the device is in APmode? 

   A2：If you fill in with wrong SSID and StaKey, it will fail to switch to APSTA mode and return to APmode.

3. Q3：Why there is no instructions after switching mode? 

   A3：After switching mode, the gateway will restart WiFi or even switch LAN LAN / WAN lead to disconnect the computer from the device, then the computer will lose the gateway device IP.

4. Q4：Gateway/server can’t receive uplink data? 

   A4：Please check the SDK configuration on the web page. Please make sure the configurations are same in both GW/server and node side.

5. Q5：How to do when the firmware upgrade fail? 

   A5：Power on RHF2S024, it means the upgrading fails when the system led doesn’t start to blink slowly in 3 min. Please refer to section 6 of this document to repeat the upgrading steps.

6. Q6： What is the range of the DHCP pool? 

   A6：The DHCP pool is from xxx.xxx.xxx.100 ~ xxx.xxx.xxx.254. Modification is not acceptable.

## Network Problems

1. Q1：Fail to connect to internet after switching mode? 

   A1：If switching to APmode, please check whether the higher-level router can access to the Internet, or the higher-level router is in static IP mode. 

   If switching to APSTA mode, please check whether the StaSsid and StaKey are correct when connecting to the higher-level router. If it fail to switch mode, it will return to APmode. 

   If switching to PPPoE mode, please confirm whether Username and Password are correct, or whether the account has been disabled by the operator.

2. Q2：How do I determine that the gateway is already connected to the cloud server? 

   A2：When the gateway is connected to the cloud server, the cloud server shows the gateway on line. If the gateway is not connected to the cloud server, follow these steps to troubleshoot: 

   1) Check whether the gateway is connected to the Internet, you can do it in the web page Network-> Diagnostics. Ping succeed means the device connect to network, ortherwise the device disconnect to network.

   2) If the device connects to the Internet, you have to check the cloud server address, the uplink and downlink port, and Lora boot SDK configuration.
