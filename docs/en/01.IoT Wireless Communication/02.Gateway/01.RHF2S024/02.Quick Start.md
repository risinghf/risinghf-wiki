## 1. Quick To Use

RHF2S024 is a plug and play LoRaWAN gateway, built-in with applications connected to cloud server. In default it will be connected to the http://cn1.loriot.io server. User doesn’t need install any software. User just needs to read the MAC address from the label of the gateway device and register it in the Loriot server. And connect the GW to the router via cable. Open the web UI to set the gateway frequency. Then power on it that the device would connect to the server automatically.

### 1.1. Connect to the server

1. New users need register an account in http://cn1.loriot.io

2. Enter Dashboard -> Gateways -> Add Gateway

7.  Open the gateway web UI, enter “Lora->Packet forwarder” menu. The "Global Config" select the frequency plan corresponding to the gateway, click "Enable", submit the configuration and open the SDK.

8. LoRaWAN communication demo

   ::: warning

   note: Register a node in the cloud server to do LoRaWAN communication demo. Please refer to RisingHF RHF3M076 user manual ”[RHF-PS01509]LoRaWAN Class AC AT Command Specification - v4.3” for how to use RisingHF LoRaWAN modem.

   :::

   When the LoRa led turn to green from red, it connected to the cloud server. And you could do LoRaWAN communication with the node.

   >The green power LED will be ON; 
   >
   >The green system LED will blink; 
   >
   >The red WiFi LED will be ON; (AP mode) 
   >
   >The green LoRaWAN LED will be ON; 
   >
   >The USB LED will be off;

### 1.2. Connect to internet in different modes and modes switch

There are wireless WiFi and wired cable two ways to connect to the internet for RHF2S024. In wireless WiFi mode, the device could connect to the network via the router by wireless way. And the device could also connect to the internet via DHCP, Static and PPPOE mode.

#### 1.2.1. AP mode

AP mode is RHF2S024’s factory default mode. In this mode, the gateway could connect to the network via DHCP way with a cable. Please connect RHF2S024 network port to the DHCP LAN port of the router with the network cable. 

Except the DHCP, RHF2S024 also supports Static IP access. Please access to the web configuration to switch the mode.

1. Get IP address of the device

   1. Scan the SSID of RHF2S024 in your PC and connect your PC to the device, usually with the default name “RisingHF_XXXXXX”, “XXXXXX” stands for last 3bytes of the device MAC address. After your PC connecting to the device, you could get the default ip 192.168.100.1.
   2. Connect both your PC and RHF2S024 to the same router, then you could obtain the IP address via DHCP service.

2. Login. Default Username：admin；Password：admin

5. Click “Switch protocol” to wait for tens of seconds to connect to the internet.

#### 1.2.2. AP/STA mode

In this mode, RHF2S024 gateway will have both AP and STA functions. The gateway will connect to the internet and cloud server via wireless WiFi, and also provide WiFi services to others stations.

1. On the web page, click Network->Mode

   ![](https://wiki.risinghf.com/upload/img/afb448ec3041f70a476d4feba43fb9a6.png)

2. Select APSTA in the “Network mode” field and click “Scan wifi“

   ![](https://wiki.risinghf.com/upload/img/adc10e3a7c16feb85c2815eabc962535.png)

3. In the StaSsid field, select the gateway SSID you want to connect to and enter the password in StaKey

   ![](https://wiki.risinghf.com/upload/img/048e89260508da5b1a44fceb8bb7b101.png)

4. Click “Switch mode” to switch mode, wait about 1 minute till the page will automatically refresh, or you could refresh the page by manual. The WiFi led will turn green if it succeeds. If you fill in with wrong Stakey or invalid SSID, the device will return to AP mode.

   >
   >The green system LED will blink; 
   >
   >The green WiFi LED will be ON; (AP/STA mode) 
   >
   >The green LoRaWAN LED will be ON;
