## Overview

The RHF2SG03 Smart Circuit Breaker Gateway is a wireless gateway designed to connect and control RS485 circuit breakers, catering to industrial or consumer site applications. It aims to ensure efficient operation of power systems, electrical safety, and energy-saving as well as emission reduction.

The primary functions of the smart circuit breaker gateway include electricity data collection (such as energy consumption, active power, power factor, voltage, current, and leakage current). Additionally, it can control the closing and opening of circuit breakers through remote commands, local rule-based control, and environmental linkage control.

The gateway connects to circuit breakers via an RS485 interface and uses Cat 1 network access to integrate with a system management platform. This enables device management, data management, remote control, and remote firmware upgrades.

The smart circuit breaker gateway is powered by a 220V supply, with an operating power consumption of less than 4W. It operates within a temperature range of  -40°C to 85°C  and features an ABS plastic enclosure. With dimensions of 100 x 36 x 67 mm, it is easy to install and supports rail-mounted installation within distribution boxes.

## Product Technical Features and Application Fields

#### Features:

- SIM Card: Push-pull pluggable SIM card slot (Micro-SIM)
- Temperature Sensing Interface: Supports external NTC resistor for flexible environmental temperature monitoring (reserved feature)
- Smart Circuit Breaker Interface: RS485 interface with configurable serial baud rate
- Circuit Breaker Control:
  Supports remote command control to open/close breakers via the management platform, local timed rule-based control, and environmental smart linkage control.
- Alarm Reporting: Supports flexible definition of alarm events on the management platform. Once alarm conditions are triggered, the gateway reports the event.
- Remote Self-Testing: The circuit breaker gateway can perform remote self-testing of breakers via the management platform.
- Remote Configuration and Monitoring: The gateway supports remote configuration, remote monitoring, and OTA remote
  firmware upgrades.
- Power Failure Detection: The gateway includes a power failure detection function. After a power outage, it uses residual power to report the downtime and other information.
- LLED Indicators: Power indicator, system indicator, RS485 interface working indicator.
- Smart Circuit Breaker Gateway and Breaker Binding Maintenance: The smart circuit breaker gateway supports RS485 interface connections for cascading up to 247 smart circuit breakers, with prior binding required. (RS485 slave addresses
  of circuit breakers must not be duplicated).
- Smart Circuit Breaker Protocol: Supports Modbus-RTU protocol, DL/T 645 protocol, and expandable protocols. When encountering unknown circuit breakers, it can perform online upgrades to configure point tables and directly expand
  connections with breakers.
- Circuit Breaker Monitoring: Monitors the circuit breaker’s online status, open/close state, closing operation duration, phase line temperature, phase voltage, phase current, leakage current, phase power factor, phase active power, total power, phase active energy, and total active
  energy. Accuracy: Class 1 (error limit <1%).
- LCD Display: Displays circuit breaker operating parameters.
- Peak Power Consumption: Less than 8W (MAX), stable power consumption less than 4W.
- Electrostatic Discharge (ESD) Protection: Contact discharge ±4kV, air discharge ±8kV.
- Operating Temperature Range: -40°C to 85°C.
- Mounting Method: Rail mounting.
- Protective Grounding: The protective grounding terminal connects to earth.
