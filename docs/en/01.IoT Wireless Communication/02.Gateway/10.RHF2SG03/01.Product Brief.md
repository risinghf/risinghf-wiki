## PRODUCT BRIEF

RHF2SG03 Smart circuit breaker gateway is designed to connect and control RS485 circuit breaker which are widely used in Industrial or consume places, to realize efficient operation of the power system and Electrical safely, energy saving.

The main function of Smart circuit breaker gateway is Electricity usage information collection (including Electric energy, Active power, Reactive power, Power factor, Voltage, Current, Leakage current), it can also control the circuit breaker switch Close or open, the circuit breaker control method can be remote command directly, or send rules to control locally, such as time-based rule task or link rule to base on other external input condition. Circuit breaker gateway use RS485 interface to connect with circuit breaker, and link to cloud management server through LTE Cat1, to achieve device management, data
management, remote control and Firmware OTA upgrade. Smart circuit breaker gateway is 220V powered directly, and the power consumption will be less than 4W. The operating temperature is -30~70 ℃ , with small size 100x36x67mm, and support DIN-Rail Mounting installation.
