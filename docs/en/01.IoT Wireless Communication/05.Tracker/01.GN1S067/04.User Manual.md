## 1 Features

GN1S067 is an intelligent LoRaWAN tracker developed by RXHF for positioning and data monitoring of cattle and sheep in the livestock industry. It supports IP67 protection class, supports all-day weather environment work, and has the characteristics of high positioning accuracy, long communication distance and long battery life time.

It has the following features and functions:

1. Support reporting GPS position, temperature and humidity, number of steps, battery voltage and other information.

   The tracker contains built-in GPS module, temperature and humidity sensor and Accelerometer sensor. The tracker will automatically report the data including sensor information periodically.

2. Supports flexible LoRaWAN report period configuration

   Users can configure the report interval by themselves. It can be divided into maximum three duration (no overlap) for the whole day time. For each duration, the different report intervals can be set freely.

3. Support automatic time synchronization 

   After the device is turned on, it will automatically obtain the time through the NS of LoRaWAN as well as from the GPS module. The time will be re-obtained from NS every 24 hours, and the device time will also be updated after each GPS positioning to ensure that the time of the device is in an accurate state.

4. Support for custom time zone

   Users can configure the time zone of their region through the APP or LoRaWAN. After configuring the time zone, other functions will work based on the configured time zone.

5. Support to configure the daily step count reset time

   Based on need, User can decide and configure the time in a day when the daily step count will be reset back to zero.

6. Support to set the number of step for GPS positioning exemption, called“exemption steps”

   Support to set the number of step for GPS positioning exemption: if the step count between each uplink interval (for example one hour) is less than the exemption steps, then for the coming uplink time, GPS positioning is not performed, and will use the previous GPS position information for this uplink reporting, so as to reduce the power consumption and extend the service life of the product.

7. Supports all LoRaWAN frequency plans worldwide 

   It supports CN470, EU868, IN865, AS923, US915 and other frequency plans.

8. Support LoRaWAN uplink packet re-transmission if lost 

   After the device enables the re-transmission function, all LoRaWAN uplink data frames will be changed into Confirm frames. Once the device does not receive the downlink ACK after a confirm uplink, the device assumes that the communication has failed and saves the data in the local queue. When the next uplink successfully receives the ACK and the RSSI is greater than -100, the data in the local queue will be re-transmitted in order until the local queue is empty. If the re-transmission fails again, the previous process will be repeated and the retransmission will continue after waiting for a successful ACK reception.

9. Support relay function to forward the LoRaWAN class A message of slave node in ABP mode

   Tracker is a master device in relay function. This function can be enabled through APP or LoRaWAN, And support query, add, delete slave operations. When the function is enabled and the slave is added, the slave can send a wake-up frame to wake up the master, and the master forwards the uplink data of the slave to help the slave complete the communication.

10. Support remote configuration of related parameters through LoRaWAN network

    Users can configure part of the parameters through the LoRaWAN network downlink.

11. Support mobile APP query and configuration parameters and firmware upgrade

    You can configure more parameters and update the firmware through the APP.

12. Support multiple alerts

    When the power is less than 10%, the low power alarm bit in the reported data will be set to 1. When the power is less than 5%, the device will shut down after the last packet of data is uploaded. 

    When the GPS positioning fails, the positioning failure alarm will be set to 1 in the reported data, and the next success will cancel the alarm. 

    When the re-transmission function is enabled, the alarm bit for re-transmission will be set to 1 in the reported data. Enable will increase power consumption, to alert the user.

    When the relay function is enabled, the relay alarm bit will be set to 1 in the reported data. Enable will increase power consumption, to alert the user.

## 2 Local control and Indication Light

This product does not have a physical button, a Hall sensor is used instead. 

So a magnet is used to trigger the Hall sensor to locally control the device.

This device has two LEDs, the colors are green and blue. Different functions are triggered by the length of the trigger time of the Hall sensor, and different functions can be distinguished by the LED indication, and the user can trigger the corresponding action through the magnet, as shown in the following table.

![image-20230829163916654](https://wiki.risinghf.com/upload/img/1823075274718fcea00383c317eed71a.png)

**Note**: when the corresponding LED indication ON, remove the magnet to trigger the corresponding function. If the magnet is not removed for a long time, the two LEDs will be off after 15 seconds, and then remove the magnet will not trigger any function.

## 3 Quick start

### 3.1 Product registration

This product uses LoRaWAN mode for communication, so please register the device on LoRaWAN network server before use. Please seek help from your network server supplier for registration method on NS.

This product is in ABP mode. Please contact RisingHF sales for its ID and key information. 

After registration, and user turns on the device using a magnet, the tracker will firstly report the version information of the device, followed by a GPS positioning and other data sensing work, the first GPS positioning takes about 60 seconds to execute. If there is no GPS signal in the room, it will time out after 60 seconds, the positioning will fail, and the device will report the packet without GPS data (Function code ID = 0x03). Otherwise, in the case of successful position, the device reports a packet with GPS data (Function code ID = 0x01).

The LoRaWAN message default PORT is 8.

### 3.2 Power-ON and Power-OFF

When you receive the device first time, it is in powered off mode by factory default.

In the power-off state, the magnet triggers the Hall sensor until the blue light flashes (trigger is about 10 seconds), and then remove the magnet to power on the device. After remove magnet the blue light stays on for about 3 seconds, indicating that the device is successfully powered on. At this time, the BLE broadcast will open and keep for 1 minute.

In the power-on state, the magnet trigger until the green light flashes. Remove the magnet, and the device will open BLE broadcast and keep for 1 minute for the APP to connect to the device. 

In the power-on state, the magnet trigger until the blue light flashes. Remove the magnet, and the device will shut down at this time. The blue light will flash for about 3 seconds and enter power-off state.

### 3.3 Fast trigger uplink

In the power-on state, the magnet is used to trigger until the two lights flicker at the same time then remove the magnet, the device will trigger an uplink. This is called field testing mode, it is useful to evaluate the communication signal quality with the LoRaWAN gateway or want to check if device is working, don’t activate this mode if not needed. This process does not perform GPS positioning, the last GPS positioning data is used. However, it will update the latest temperature and humidity, battery voltage and other data.

At this time, the device will quickly uplink a data packet with the header of “Function ID”=0x01 or 0x03 (0x01: last GPS positioning success; 0x03: last positioning failure). In order to save time for fast uplink, the device will not perform GPS positioning at this time, but use the results of the previous positioning, and the data of other sensors will be updated to the latest, and then reported.

Please refer to " GN1S067-LoRaWAN Platform Protocol V1.2.pdf " for details and analysis of the reported data.

### 3.4 Normal uplink periodically

After Tracker is powered on, it will uplink message every hour by default, user can change the period interval by APP or LoRaWAN downlink command.

Uplink message including GPS position data, Humidity and temperature, step count and battery voltage, if GPS positioning success then uplink message will follow the format with function ID 0x01; If GPS positioning fails, then uplink message will be Heartbeat message which follows the format with function ID 0x03.

Any time if Alarm happens, device will trigger uplink alarm message, following the format with function ID 0x04.

For detail LoRaWAN application protocol, please refer to《GN1S067-LoRaWAN application protocol-v1.2.pdf》

## 5 APP Instructions

The device has a corresponding mobile APP to cooperate with it. Currently, the APP only has an Android version.

The APP establishes a connection with the device via Bluetooth. The APP will disconnect the Bluetooth connection from the device when: 

Case 1: more than five minutes without any active action with the device will trigger the disconnection of the Bluetooth connection and return to the home page. 

Case 2: The mobile phone actively turns off Bluetooth, which will trigger the disconnection of Bluetooth and return to the home page. 

Case 3: When clicking the back button in the upper left corner or the mobile phone operation returns to the upper level, the Bluetooth connection will be disconnected and the home page will be returned.

### 5.1 Connecting device

First, log in to the APP and click the device icon of GN1S067 to scan the device. Use a magnet to power on the device, or turn on the device's BLE broadcast, so that the APP can scan the device and connect.

![image-20230829172255818](https://wiki.risinghf.com/upload/img/6342d4194fdf3719641bcd18cd6583d0.png)

Click the scanned device to initiate a Bluetooth connection. If the connection is successful, you proceed to the next page, and the device's green light will flash to indicate a successful connection.

### 5.2 Get device info

After successfully connecting the Bluetooth of the device in the previous step, the detail page is entered, which contains all the information of the device, including three categories: basic information, LoRaWAN related information, and sensor information. Users can scroll down to view various types of information, and can click the refresh button to refresh the corresponding information.

![image-20230829172344348](https://wiki.risinghf.com/upload/img/9e87026c8523cd8e3823f8d07af13b79.png)

![image-20230829172352047](https://wiki.risinghf.com/upload/img/fc108bea00c4c8d2bff8b949aa2a9cfe.png)

![image-20230829172359935](https://wiki.risinghf.com/upload/img/44e1c46ae0e0b39a077f31d8780c9da5.png)

**Note**: When acquiring sensor data, GPS positioning takes a long time, so it is slow, taking up to 1 minute.

### 5.3 Parameter configure

After the user makes a parameter change, he needs to click the Confirm button for the change to take effect. It is recommended to return to the detail page after the modification to refresh the parameters and confirm whether the modification was successful.

- Base configure

  Click the setting interface to enter the following page:

  ![image-20230829172743684](https://wiki.risinghf.com/upload/img/461837788a892e1e54c144abd967e155.png)

  In this page, users can configure the report period, location resend function, time zone, step count clear time, and free step count (also known as GPS positioning exemption above). The location mode and the remove alarm need not be set and are reserved for future use.

  Here are some basic configurable parameters: 

  1. Report period: When configuring this parameter, the report period cannot be repeated, otherwise the configuration fails. For example, if user wants to configure the whole day period, it needs to be configured from 00:00-23:59. If it is configured from 00:00-00:00, the configuration will fail. The check box after the report period needs to be checked for the configuration for that time period to take effect. 

  2. Location Resend: When this function is not turned on, all LoRaWAN uplink use unconfirmed frames; When the function is enabled, the device will send an alarm frame with Function ID 0x04 to notify the NS or AS device to enable the location resend function. All uplink will use confirm frame, and if no ACK is received, the data will be cached in the local buffer area. The next uplink and ACK is received, and the RSSI is greater than -100, the cached historical data will be uplink to NS again. 

  3. Time zone: users can flexibly adjust the time zone according to the location, and the report period time and the step clearing time will automatically match the time zone. 

  4. Step count clear time: The step number of the device will clear every day. The user can specify the time point of step clear through this parameter. 

  5. Free step count: When the next report comes and the step difference is not greater than the value, GPS positioning is not performed, and the last GPS information is used for reporting, so as to reduce the power consumption and extend the service life of the product.

- Advanced configure

  Click the Advanced configuration button to open the drop-down box to see the parameters related to LoRaWAN:

In the figure above, only one relay slave can be added at a time; in the figure, the slave with Devaddr 55665566 is added. You need to click Confirm for the changes to take effect. A maximum of 10 slaves can be added, and when more than 10, the addition failure will be prompted. 

Note: At least one slave Devaddr must be added to enable the relay function successfully.

The current APP has no interface for deletion and query. If you need to query or delete, you need to switch to the serial port tool page and use the AT command to complete it.

- Query: AT+TRELAY=LIST

  The result is shown in the following figure. All added slave devices will be displayed in the interface. 00:00:00:00 means that the position is empty, and a new slave can be add.

- Delete: AT+TRELAY=DEL, 55665566

  After using the command, the slave 55665566 will be deleted, and the reply +TRELAY: OK indicates that the deletion is successful.

### 5.5 Firmware upgrade

In the upgrade page, user can check the current software version number, and the APP will prompt user if there is a new firmware that can be updated.

When you need to upgrade, select the corresponding software version number and confirm the upgrade. This process takes about 1 minute.

When the progress bar reaches 100%, the device will disconnect from the Bluetooth connection. After about 10 seconds, the device will complete the firmware update, and the blue light will stay on for 3 seconds. At this time, the APP can search the device again and initiate the connection. 

If the upgrade fails, the previous operation is repeated.
