# Ladtp Component

## 1 Introduction

The Ladtp service component is a sub-component of the IoTSquare platform. It has the functions of merging uplink data packets, splitting downlink data packets, state management, configuration management, etc. If the laptp extension protocol is selected when creating an application, the uplink data of all nodes in this application will be forwarded to the Ladtp component for processing.

## 2 Ladtp Device Configuration

Users need to refer to the RHF3M485 manual, use the serial port tool to connect to the PC, you can use the following AT command to set the RHF3M485 node.

### 2.1 Set Frequency

**Input:**

```
AT+DR
```

Used to query the current frequency plan, the frequency plan determines the current available channel

**Output:**

```
+DR: DR0
+DR: CN470PREQUEL DR0 SF12 BW125K
```

The above output indicates that the current frequency plan is CN470PREQUEL, if modified to CN470, you need to execute the following AT command.

**Input:**

```
AT+DR=CN470
```

**Output:**

```
+DR: CN470
```

Note: When modifying the frequency plan, it may return "+DR: ERROR", which is normal; at this time, just continue to set it a few times until it returns to normal!



### 2.2 Set Channel

**Input:**

```
AT+CH
```

It is used to query the current available data transmission channel. The transmission channel of the node should be consistent with the receiving channel of the gateway. Otherwise, the data sent by the node may not be received by the gateway.

**Output:**

```
+CH: 8; 0,471500000,DR0,DR5; 1,471700000,DR0,DR5; 2,471900000,DR0,DR5; 3,472100000,DR0,DR5; 4,472300000,DR0,DR5; 5,472500000,DR0,DR5; 6,472700000,DR0,DR5; 7,472900000,DR0,DR5;
```

If the setting in step (1) is AT+DR=CN470, then there will be a total of 96 available channels starting from channel 470.3MHz on channel 0 and ending at 489.3MHz on channel 95, when 0-7 channels are selected. At the time, the following AT commands can be used:

**Input:**

```
AT+CH=NUM,0-7
```

**Output:**

```
+CH: NUM, 0-7
```



### 2.3 Set Serial Port

**Input:**

```
AT+UARTDFU
```

The above AT command is used to query the serial port configuration information of the module. It is not the same serial port as the serial port of the configure port. The serial port stop bit of the data segment is fixed to 1. The baud rate, parity bit and data bit can be set.

**Output:**

```
+UARTDFU: 2400,1,8
```

The above output indicates that the current communication port has a baud rate of 2400 bps, odd parity bits (0: no parity, 1: odd parity, 2: even parity), and the data bit is 8, if you want to modify the baud rate to 9600, even parity, 8-bit data bits, you need to execute the following AT command.

**Input:**

```
AT+UARTDFU=9600，2，8
```

**Output:**

```
+UARTDFU: 9600,2,8
```

Note: The configuration here should be consistent with the serial port configuration of the devices (such as sensors) connected to the RHF3M485 module!



### 2.4 Select Serial Port

**Input:**

```
AT+COMMODE
```

Query the connection mode between the current device and the RHF3M485 module, whether it is RS485 interface or RS232 interface.

**Output:**

```
+COMMODE: RS485
```

The above output indicates that the connection mode between the current module and the terminal is RS485, then the RS232 port is unavailable, if modified to RS232, you need to execute the following AT command.

**Input:**

```
AT+COMMODE=RS232
```

**Output:**

```
+COMMODE: RS232
```



## 3 Gateway Configuration

The configuration of the gateway is not described in detail here. If you are using the RisingHF gateway, please check the manual of the corresponding gateway model.

Note: Ensure that the RHF3M485 transmit channel is a subset of the gateway receive channel and that the gateway is normally linked to the server platform.

For example: The current available transmission channel of RHF3M485 is 470.3~471.9 (0-7 channels of CN470), then the receiving channel of the gateway should also be 8 or more.

## 4 Ladtp Service Component

### 4.1 Create Application

When the user creates the ladtp application, you need to select the ladtp protocol in the extended protocol drop-down box. The push interface can be filled in either http or https. The user can also fill in the token information in the header field to increase the security of the user push interface and create a ladtp. After the application, all the nodes in this application are defaulted to the lattp node. Tip: When creating an application, please do not enable MQTT permission.

### 4.2 Create Device

The user creates the device, fills in DevEUI, AppEUI, AppKey, frequency area and device type as required to register the device.

![Create Device](创建设备.png)

### 4.3 Function List

Click on the created device, it will jump to the device details page, click the Ladtp component drop-down box, you can see the following Ladtp function module, mainly has the following function modules, such as status management, configuration management, downlink window, uplink history, etc.

![Function List](组件功能列表.png)

### 4.4 Status Management

Click Ladtp Status button to view the status information of this Ladtp device. By default, the server does not automatically obtain the device status. You need to click Latest Status Ladtp Device button of the Ladtp device to get the device status information. After clicking Latest Status Ladtp Device button of the Ladtp device, after about 5 seconds, click the refresh button to see the latest status information of the Ladtp device.
